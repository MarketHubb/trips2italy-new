The itinerary planned was awesome and they experienced quite a bit in a short timeframe. You and your team provided exceptional customer service and ensured every detail was covered from start to finish. The girls are safely enroute  back to NYC. \n\nWe will definitely recommend your company with our friends and family who want to experience Italy, as well as come back to you when the girls plan their trip to the Amalfi Coast in 2020. \n\nWarm regards,\n\nThe Allen family","pagination" => "","location" => "Houston, TX"],
    ["web-scraper-start-url" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews","title" => "Carole W. & George R. - Italy first time Vacation Amalfi Coast , Rome and Florence and Tuscany","content" => "Buongiorno Tommaso,\n\nOur trip was amazing! You are your team did a terrific job with preparing the itinerary and getting us ready for our journey. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to provide feedback. Overall, we found our itinerary to be planned well with enough time to do things that were not pre-planned. The guidebook was great, especially the restaurant lists. We had very few problems and the one time we needed to reach out to your team for help, Giulia was very responsive.\n\nAttached is a detailed summary of our feedback. We hope it helps with planning future trips.\n\n100% Positive Review:\n1.\tTrastevere Food walking tour – In one word, spectacular. The guide was terrific and the places we visited were so authentic. Based on this tour, we will request 3-4 walking dinner tours on our next visit.\n2.\tPrivate guide tours in general – Super personal attention; feel like the guides were able to open up and be more relaxed and humorous than with bigger groups. This is a must.\n3.\tFlorence – loved the City and the history hidden within the City.\n4.\tRestaurants you Recommended – we ate at 75% of the restaurants you recommended and all positive reviews.\n5.\tDay trip from Siena to Florence stopping in the Brunello region for a wine tasting – our guide was a AAA+ and the vineyard (family run) was beautiful.\n6.\tGalleria Borghese – this turned out to be one of our favorites and we loved the huge park surrounding the Galleria.\n7.\tPompei – breathtaking – a must to visit. Guide was an AAA+.\n8.\tPath of the Gods Trek - breathtaking – guide was an AAA+. Our trek took approx. 2.5 hrs. It was so pretty that we would have loved a 4-6-hour trek.\n9.\tCapri Boat Excursion – another must and perfect at the end of our trip since very relaxing. The captain and his mate were terrific.\n10.\tOur Travels from North to South – starting in the historic inner city of Siena, to the hidden treasures of Florence, to Rome and its historic sites, to Pompei and finally to the coast was the perfect progression and the right order of seeing the cities we planned.   \n11.\tStatue of David – a must! It was by far the most breathtaking and thought-provoking statue we saw.\n12.\tYour Guide & Ticket Books – perfect for planning and information.\n13.\tHaving 80% of our Trip Pre-Planned w/Guides/Tours – a must.\n14.\tTrain rides from one city to another – the best way to travel. Easy to locate and relaxing (and as a plus, the cars we were in were not crowded).  \n\nTweaks in the Planning:1.\tVintage Fiat 500 Tour – took a bit for all to get registered (unproductive time) in order to drive, bike, etc. Driving a 50-year old small auto with a just as old transmission was more fun on paper than reality. Would have preferred to take a small group bus to more than one (1) vineyard for the excursion. In the time it took to register, park, ensure we were all together, etc., we could have visited three (3) vineyards. We would not recommend this Fiat excursion as a way to see Tuscany.\n2.\tFlorence Food Tour – based on the 10a start, this tour took up most of our morning and afternoon. After the Trastevere evening tour, our preference would be a similar dinner Florence tour so we would have the entire day to explore other activities – the guide for the tour was AAA+.\n3.\tIn Rome, we would have preferred to be in a hotel located closer to the Colosseum. The location of the Palazzo Navona Hotel felt remote from the points of interest we wanted to see (other than the Vatican). \n4.\tColosseum and Forum Tour – scheduling this tour late in the afternoon (upon arrival) was not great. This was high on our list of “must sees” and we didn’t get to spend any time on our own exploring the Forum area. We spent 2 of the 3 hours at the Colosseum and the Forum was closing 15 minutes after we were done with the tour. Would recommend a morning tour to allow for time to exploring after. The tour itself was breathtaking and the guide was an AAA+.\n5.\tScheduling the Colosseum/Forum upon arrival in Rome followed by an early start for the Vatican the next day was rough. We crashed after the Vatican tour. We were in Rome for 4 nights – this could have been scheduled better.\n6.\tLayover in Newark – if possible, a five (5) hour layover in Newark would not be our preference after a nine (9) hour flight. We realize this could have been caused by the Air France cancellation.   \n\nOn a side note, while the Vatican was must, it was not our favorite visit. It was a bit overwhelming and per the time allotted for the tour, an extremely fast paced tour. While we can say that we saw the Vatican, we really didn’t see the Vatican. No question that the number of people visiting makes it a challenging tour.\n\nThanks again for making our first trip to Italy so memorable. We are already looking forward to our next visit and will definitely reach out to you when we are ready to start planning.\n\nGrazie mille, \n\nCarole & George","pagination" => "","location" => "Flower Mound, TX"],

The trip was fabulous. All the plans were set up perfectly, everything went off like clockwork. We really appreciated the special service we received everywhere we went. (Walking out to the canal, when we were leaving Venice and having the water taxi drive up at exactly the scheduled time was perfect. The topper was when he called out, are you Michael, just made us feel like we were special.)\n\n Our favorite tour of all was the food and wine tour in Rome. The tour guide really knew her stuff and the places she took us were so interesting. The food was authentic and locals were unique and memorable.\n\n The cooking class in Florence was fabulous. By luck only 8 people were signed up, so we had a small fun group experience. The chefs were entertaining and really made the cooking a joyful learning experience. \n\n Our least favorite tour was the food and wine tour in Venice. It lacked excitement and the choices of locals she took us to were less than stelar. While this was our first tour, the rest of the trip more than made up for one mediocre experience. \n\n Each hotel location was excellent. The staff was helpful, cheerful and really took care of us well. We asked a lot of them to recommend where they would eat to keep us away from the obvious tourist eateries. We were not disappointed. In fact, we ate really, really well. (Do you have an after trip diet program?) We know that the Agriturismo that we went to was a new location for you, so we wanted to let you know how excellent it was. This was our favorite spot of all and it was truly difficult to leave. Next time, I’d plan more time to just enjoy the countryside and pool. (Oh by the way, make sure you tell people to pack a swimsuit. I didn’t and that was my only disappointment). \n\n We would not hesitate to recommend your services to anyone. You were professional and your attention to detail was amazingly helpful. It took our worries away and made our experiences that much more enjoyable.  \n\n We would be remiss in not telling you our one huge complaint…The trip was too short and we had to come back to reality. \n\n Thank you for everything. \n\n Ciao\n\n Robin and Michael","pagination" => "","location" => "Milpitas, CA"],

By now you know that I am not shy and will share our comments.\n\nChristine D. and I have returned from Italy and wanted to thank you for planning one of our best trips.\nThe hotels were terrific, but best of all the number of days in each town were perfect.   \nThe guides went out of their way to make sure we saw everything and added their personal anecdotes to make our trip come alive.   \nThe guide in Cinque Terre actually reserved a small boat for us instead of dealing with the large crowds on the ferry - it was wonderful.\n\nWe thought we would pass along some comments which may help you when you are planning future clients' trips to this area. These are not criticisms, just comments.\n\nPerugia \n\nLoved this area of Italy - so much to see and learn - would tell people not to skip it.\n#1   Hotel San Gallo Palazzo\n\nThe staff couldn't have been nicer - helping us with our questions (and we had many!), providing maps, bringing us coffee when we sat on their large veranda reviewing our full day of sightseeing, etc.  \nBreakfast was outstanding!    \nProbably the best of the 3 hotels \n\nThis hotel was so convenient to the sites that we had no issues walking all over town on our free days and in the evening.\nNote:   The San Gallo hotel restaurant was not included on your recommended list, but was probably one of the best dinners we ate.  You may want to consider adding it to your list.\n\nSiena\n\n#2  Hotel Palazzo Ravizza - we weren't sure if the driver was dropping us off at the correct location because the sign on the building read \"Pensione\" not Hotel; but we were so happy once inside the building.   This mansion's rooms were all redone to provide a different style for most guests.   Updated bathrooms, coffee pots in each room, even an iron and ironing board!!!  \nSince our rooms over looked the garden (thanks to you) we had the most incredible views watching the sun rise through our large bedroom windows.    We took a tour of the building which still houses a grand piano, antiques and furniture from the original owner.   \nThe wife of the owner of the NY Frick museum typically stayed here when in Italy.\n\nBreakfast was different than the previous hotel. The salami and cheese was delicious and plentiful. Coffee was magnifique (once we learned to use the machine)!\n\nWe had such fun at the cooking school learning how to make pasta and sauces.   Of course, we ate too much and have fond memories of the people we met and the Chef who used much more salt and wine than Americans.\nViVace Pizza & Grigila was also not on your recommended restaurant list, but was excellent with a beautiful back terrace overlooking the city lights.  This is located right around the corner from the hotel.\n\nSanta Margherita \n#3   The  Mediterranneo Emotional Hotel was also very nice, located close to everything so we were able to walk to sites and restaurants.   Of course, the building was newly renovated. \n\nHow can we ever thank you enough for working so hard on each and every detail of our trip.   We couldn't stop saying this is the most beautiful site, until we moved to the next one.\n\nSo looking forward to our next grand trip.   By the way, do you provide trips to other countries in addition to Italy?\n\nYour Very Happy Clients,\n\nWendy and Christine","pagination" => "","location" => "Township of Washington, NJ"],
    ["web-scraper-start-url" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews","title" => "Stuart and Faith C. - Italy Florence Rome Wedding Anniversary Vacation ","content" => "Emily, \n\nWe had a good time and appreciate all the hard work you put into the planning.  Pre plan discussion helped a lot along with the documents you provided us.  Lots to share but I will try to give a quick perspective--\n\n Alitalia really needs to update itself, the plane interiors are beaten up and the staff is not really that friendly.  I travel internationally and I would put them really at the bottom of choice especially for long hauls.  We understand it is the direct route airline but it would be great if there was competition to force better service.\n\n Taxi services- Rome Airport to Hotel leaves a bit to be desired.  The driver was late, didn't speak english and he tried but we felt like we were just a package to pick up and deposit.  Florence to Airport was ok but felt badly for driver.  The driver was doing a favor for a colleague as the colleague was sick.  The driver parked down the street vs being in front of the hotel.  We were fine to carry our stuff to the car but didn't seem the best.  She also had a tour right after dropping us off and was concerned about timing.   She was nice and conversant on Florence sites as we went to the airport.  We are sympathetic to the circumstances but my sense is the Taxi company needs to handle all these situations to ensure we are not caught up in the juggle.  Not fair to drivers.  We are easy travelers and these situations were not major issues it just made us think about service.\n\n Rail travel was great in Italy.  High-speed service Rome to Florence and Florence to/from Venice was easy and great ride.  Train stations are nice, information is easy and there are helpful folks always around to ask questions.   \n\nHotel in Rome was ok.  Staff was very nice and the garden area for drinks and breakfast was nice.  Location was fine as we were able to access various areas of our interests in Rome.   It definitely has the decor of an older era hotel which brings some original character to it.  Rooms are a nice size and very tall ceilings.  We had a room in the backside of the hotel with a very limited view- the window was in the back corner of the room and looked out into sidewall of an adjacent building.  It would have been better to have a window in the center or in a way that provided more look to the outside.  We requested a change but they couldn't accommodate.   Since we were out and about all the time it ended up not being an issue.  We like both kinds of hotels- old ones with history and newer modern ones- but being in a historical city the older hotel is preferable.  One aspect that needs fixing is their breakfast.  Good spread but hot food especially the eggs were cold and slightly undercooked.  Also, some of the staff was not able to communicate very well which resulted in incorrect orders.  Outside garden service in the evening was a bit slow.\n\n Hotel in Florence was great.  Rooms and reception areas were small but it didn't matter as we thought they did nice job of leveraging the space, the staff was great, very welcoming and always helpful.  Breakfast was perfect and the afternoon tea was a really nice touch.  Location was fine.  We were able to walk to it from the train station and get to all areas of Florence that we wanted to get to.  We would recommend Rapallo to anybody.\n\n Rome- when we arrived we wandered around the city during the afternoon- walking past Giardini del Quirinale to Fontana di Trevi, exploring other areas then to P. Venizea, went to the top to see good 360 views of Rome, etc...  Next day- the Coliseum/Forum/Pantheon tour was great, the tour guide was good and would really recommend it to anybody.  Learned a lot.  Glad we had the small group tour.  Have to say the big tours were obnoxious as they just would bowl you over as they came thru.  Amazing that tours can be so large.  Vatican city tour was great and informative.  \nWe got lucky as we were the only ones on the tour.  Rome is an amazing city and the history is fascinating.\n\n  Florence- walking tour was great but I think given the history and all that resides in Florence I might recommend an additional tour or two to cover some of the other topics. The Tuscany Countryside tour was great.  We lucked out to have Pierre as a tour guide.  Highly recommend that group.  Rebecca and Pierre have a great set up and very nice.  We saw three vineyards, had a great lunch with additional tastings from the restaurantor as he and his two brothers produce wine for the restaurant only, and we also made a stop in Greve. \n\nUffizi and Accademia were great to see.  Amazing history and significance.  We also went to the Leonardi Da Vinci museum and Santa Croce along with the leather school.  We ventured up to the P Michaelangelo and got great views of Florence.  If we had time we would have gone at sunset as we can imagine watching the sunset over Florence would be amazing.  We walked down and looked at the waterfalls then walked to Ponte Vecchio.    Restaurants- where do we start?  lots of good times having lunch and dinners. \n\nTrattoria Za Za and Osteria Pastella in Florence hit the top of the list.  We will have to look at our list to send along but we had good meals, wine, and enjoyed going out to the restaurants. \n\nOverall, the trip was excellent and have lots of pictures to sort thru. Will send along some.  \n\nStuart","pagination" => "","location" => "Needham, MA"],

On our last day in Rome we explored Villa Borghese Park and the National Gallery of Modern Art - both were fantastic, and a nice way to spend a cool, quiet day after the more crowded attractions.\n\nSame in Sorrento. I loved the hotel and location – being so close to the beach. The whole marina area was charming and felt like home. We had dinner there most nights, swam, and walked up into the town on our first evening and free day. The Amalfi coast tour was beautiful, as was the Capri small boat tour. \nI was thrilled with the opportunity to swim off the boat in such brilliant blue water. The captain and guide were charming and funny. On our last day we found Gallery Raffaele Celentano which we thoroughly enjoyed, and in the evening stumbled into a music performance in a small church - magical! \n\nI also enjoyed all the wonderful detail in the guidebook that was created for us - not only great information, but proverbs and recipes. :-) \n\nThanks so much for putting together such a great trip, one that was truly perfect for us. You nailed it!\n– Suzanne","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/2","location" => "West Milford, NJ"],

Tommaso, you and your team did a phenomenal job planning our trip - we saw so many incredible places, made a lot of wonderful memories, and tasted so much delicious food. And we got engaged! \n\nWe are very grateful to Trips 2 Italy for your enthusiasm, professionalism, and helpfulness helping to plan the proposal and our entire vacation. Your communication was excellent and you were so easy to work with. \n\nYou really went above and beyond to help make sure everything went smoothly for us on our special day and we can't thank enough for that. You also gave us so many helpful tips during our pre-trip phone call and the materials Trips 2 Italy sent us (vouchers, tickets, a booklet on the places we were visiting) were all top-notch. It was so helpful and informative to have your references, recommendations, and write-ups for each location.\n\nWe really loved Verona and Turin in particular. In both cities, we had excellent tour guides that taught us about the history of the cities and also gave us a glimpse into what life is like for the locals there. As an added bonus, both tours featured samples of local drinks and foods. We also had an especially incredible day when we got engaged, as we had a private driver show us the beautiful countryside and vineyards of Verona and Lake Garda. \n\nIt was truly unforgettable!\n\nIf we could take our trip again, We probably would've liked to have more individual/private tours instead of the big group tours that departed from Milan. We don't blame Trips 2 Italy for this at all, however - we told you our budget constraints and even asked if you could cut the total price a bit. In the future, we'd probably plan on spending a bit more money for private or small tours, since they really offered a unique and enhanced experience.\n\nWe had such a wonderful time - thank you again so much for all your help and guidance throughout this entire process. You went above and beyond and we are really grateful for that. We attached a few picture highlights for you and your postcard is in the mail!\n\nGrazie mille!\n\nEvan & Casey","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/2","location" => "Masonville, NJ"],

Every single event went off without a hitch.

It was clean and the staff was fairly attentive, but I would not choose it again for the following reasons:\n\n1) location was close to train station but it was on a very busy thoroughfare with lots of street people right outside the entrance\n\n2) the room was extremely small/tight for four adults which would have been ok if there was any lounge or common space in the hotel to go to but there was not\n\n3) when we returned to the hotel in the early afternoon, a lot of the breakfast food was still sitting out in the breakfast area which seemed odd to me\n\n4) it did not have an elevator and the entrance to the hotel was on the second floor, so carrying bags up and down was cumbersome\n\nOtherwise, I would highly recommend Trips 2 Italy!

The boat ride to the museum on the Grand Canal was amazing and the views from the bridge near the museum were amazing.  The next morning we took the vaporetto again to Arsenale to see the Museo Storico Navale.  The boys loved that museum - lots of weapons, armor and models and real size ships/gondolas.  We then, since we were right there, saw part (maybe half) of the Biennale exhibition at Arsenale.  It was really interesting and the space it's in complements all the artwork very well, but its unbelievably huge!   It must take a couple of weeks to see all of the Biennale exhibitions.  After that, we walked to the tour of the Doges Palace, etc.  Our tour guide was great - did a great job, but the piazza was incredibly crowded - we could barely walk on the bridges/sidewalks to get there and people were everywhere.  Our hotel was very nice and we loved the courtyard in the mornings for breakfast and in the evenings with the bar service.  The food we ate was mostly \"on the go\" and in the touristy locations, but we did have one pretty decent dinner at a restaurant right next door (almost) to the hotel - cannot remember the name, but between the canal and the hotel.\n\n\nRome:\n\nIn Rome, we loved the tour of the Vatican - great tour guide - saw the Sistine Chapel ceiling with almost no one else in there, thanks to our guide.  He made it all really interesting and pointed out all the highlights before it got too crazy with the crowds.  Most of all, though (and it was very hot in the afternoon) the boys absolutely loved the tour guide we had for the ruins/Colosseum.  We all learned so much Roman history from him  - he brought it all to life and was great about including the teenagers in every discussion & quizzing them (they are super competitive).  They said he was the best tour guide they had ever had.  On our free day (again, very hot in Rome), we walked to all the tourist highlights and then, in the afternoon, went into a museum near the Piazza Navona  - the Museo Nazionale Roma - Palazzo Altemps.  It was very interesting to be inside the Palazzo and see the original frescos/decoration and the church inside, and the collection was good - we used the English audio guides - and it was nice to be in the air conditioning (barely anyone in the museum when we were there in the afternoon).  We didn't go to any great restaurants, but had good pizza - even went to the Hard Rock Rome one night (which was a nice break from pizza and pasta).  Our hotel was good and, again, I loved having the courtyard for breakfast and in the evening - you felt like you escaped the craziness of the city in the courtyard - very nice.  (Oh, I also went to a cafe near the hotel - Cafe Torino - where I got to see all the business people going to work & had the best cappuccino I've ever had, EVER.)  My youngest son was also happy that there was a McDonalds close to our hotels in Venice and in Rome ??.\n\n\nSorrento/Positano/Capri:\n\n(oh, as I said before, all the drivers were great and Julia? who helped us via the number you gave us to use for delays, etc. was extremely helpful) The tour of Herulaneum was also just great - learned so much - our tour guide was also so informative and made it all so interesting/brought it to life.  It was incredibly hot, so we are happy we went there and not to Pompeii.   In Sorrento, our hotel was absolutely beautiful and the service was incredible - it was like the service at the Four Seasons or some place like that.  I couldn't believe how great and attentive and helpful they were!  We loved the pool and the private beach and the views from our room and our room itself!!  It surpassed our expectations - thank you so much!  On our trip to Positano, we had a very delicious lunch at Da Vincenzo (service there was great too & they gave us this great table in the window with a view of everything - so beautiful), which was on your list of recommendations, and then spent the perfect amount of time there:  I did a bunch of shopping and when boys got bored (cause I was shopping), it was time to to back to hotel.  The next day we couldn't believe how nice the boat was for the boat tour and visit to Capri.  The small number of people, who were all very fun to be on the boat with, and the amazing boat were great and the 2 tour guides/boat captains or whatever were fabulous hosts - very fun, informative, attentive - and the snacks and drinks were great!  Loved the boat ride both there and back!  We decided not to tour anywhere in Capri and, instead, rented some chairs/towels and at lunch at Bagni  Tiberio beach club, where it was mostly locals or Italians, it looked like.  We spent the hot day in the water - boys loved it - and we had a fabulous meal with an amazing view of the water.  \n\n\nThanks, again, for organizing such an amazing, beautiful and interesting trip on such short notice!  \n\nWe have incredible pictures, saw everything we wanted to see, learned a lot and loved every minute of it!\n\nI would highly recommend you and your team at Trips2Italy to anyone - so happy that Veronica Jackson recommended you to me!\n\nBest -The Dinges Family","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/2","location" => "Burke, VA"],

I want to personally thank you, and the entire Trips2Italy Team for an unbelievable, once in a lifetime experience! Everything was wonderful….but, I did want to provide some feedback on my experiences.\n\nMilan – Hotel was outstanding. I discovered an amazing restaurant that I would highly recommend….Il Solferino. Lake Como, despite being the off-season was one of the highlights of the trip. The funicular was well worth it. \n\nVenice – Venice was mind-blowing! It was far more spectacular than I possibly imagined! The hotel was adequate. Everything is Venice was amazing. \n\nFlorence – The hotel was adequate. The trip to Pisa and the accompanying guided tour were well worth it.\n\nRome – The hotel was adequate. Rome was exceptional! So much to see and do! One of the highlights of the trip! The guides on my small group tours did an exceptional job at St. Peter’s Cathedral/Vatican Museum Tour and Ancient Rome Tour. Both guides were outstanding! I look forward to going back to Rome!\n\nNaples – Hotel was very, very, very nice! I was not impressed by Naples! I did a self-guided tour of Pompeii…and, I would not recommend that. The commuter train to Pompeii was a mess. The Amalfi Coast was spectacular. I could not imagine taking a guided tour of the Amalfi Coast….the best part was exploring on my own! I made a point to experience Naples pizza….and, I would highly recommend Da Michele and Gino Sorbillo for the best pizza!\n\nI think my take-aways from this trip are:\n\nI realized I am 4-star hotel person. The lower star hotels were all adequate; however, my expectation was a little greater. \nI really appreciated the personal touches you provided at each hotel (i.e. the birthday gift, bottle of wine, biscotti, etc.). These small gestures meant a lot…and, were greatly appreciated!\n A non-stop flight to Milan would have been more convenient than a layover in Paris. \nI know we spent quite a bit of time debating the use of a rental car in Naples for touring the Amalfi Coast. You shared your opinion of driving in Naples and on the Amalfi Coast were not recommended. After having done it….it was very easy and a much better way to see it than a guided tour! I appreciate you sharing your opinion and advising me; however, the biggest complication was locating and renting a car for my trip. In hindsight, I wish all of this had been coordinated by Trips2Italy in advance. I would recommend making it clear to customers the possible concerns….but, providing the service for them if they wish to do it.\n One of the biggest advantages to this trip was that it was the off-season! I can’t imagine travelling to these same places during peak vacation season. I would definitely do the off-season again! \n\nThe pre-arranged transportation to/from the airports was a plus! It’s one less thing you need to think about! \nWe discussed it prior to my trip….but, I would have greatly preferred electronic documents (vouchers, hotels, etc.). At least having everything available electronically as a reference or as a backup would have been much easier! \nI had never used a travel agency before…but, I am now a believer. Coordinating all of the details, the educational telephone call before the trip, etc.….were all an enormous advantage. I will definitely use Trips2Italy for my next trip to Italy. I only wish you did more than just Italy.\n\nOverall, the trip was incredible. I look forward to visiting Venice and Rome again in the future…but, I would not need to visit the other locations again.

I am so sorry for not letting you know how the trip was! I have been meaning to email you since Thursday last week, but I have been so busy with getting caught up with work and daily living.\n\n The trip was FABULOUS!!  We loved every minute! Siena was wonderful and we LOVED the hotel.  It was so quaint and charming and the view from the garden patio was amazing. And the breakfast buffet, excellent! \nAll staff were very helpful and made two dinner reservations from your list.  I don't have it in front of me at the moment, but both places were amazing. I can let you know the names if you want me to when I get home. Did I mention the view off the garden patio?? Best hotel ever. :D\n\nThe Brunello wine tour was really nice at the winery, although the one at the shop in Montelcino was ehhhh, but we loved Montelcino, although we only had like 15 minutes to walk around (which was disappointing since we got back to Siena 30 minutes early.  Beautiful little hilltop town though.  \nOur Siena small group tour was very informative and our guide was so cute and very proud of her neighborhood. Pisa and Lucca were great.  Our tour guide for Pisa was fun and knowledgeable and loved taking our picture. :) \n\nWe LOVED Lucca and YES we rode bikes- around twice and my butt was tired.  Our driver, Francesco was so friendly and so Italian!  We loved him.  \nWe were really glad we had him as our driver for Pisa/Lucca and our next day Chianti tour.  Here is where Jeff and Julie joined up with us in Florence. We changed up our towns to visit, going to Volterra (instead of Siena), San Gimignano and Castellina de Chianti. Francesco was up for driving us wherever we wanted to go. \n\nVolterra was amazing and cannot believe they still have an arch from the Etruscian times 700 BC! What!?!  \n\nWe bought stuff for a picnic lunch, bought a beautiful alabaster vase and of course gelato before going to the Chianti winery.  This wine tour was amazing, such a beautiful farm.  Having the private tour with the owner was very interesting and we met the his wife also (she being American) and she brought out a few more wines to taste. :)  And we met the winery kitty. So that evening for dinner we got the Bistecca alla Fiorentina!  Oh yes, come to Moma!! ;)\n\nLet's see, the next day we had Marco as our tour guide through Florence and he was great and very Italian. He took us to some not so touristy areas so that was nice.  We did get to the Accademia and were amazed at The David.  He is was just so perfect and so much larger than life.\nOur trip to Cinque Terre was good.  Although if I went again, I would like to do the towns by ourselves.  We didn't get to hike the trails between the towns, which we wanted to do to get some of those amazing views and people would be late meeting so that was frustrating.  Although, the lunch was fabulous Vernazza!  Our poor waiter was run to death though.  Taking care of 17 people by himself and being a little larger and unable to squeeze between chairs, made it difficult for him to fully take care of us.  That being said, Cinque Terre was just beautiful to experience; the colorful buildings on the mountainside and the crystal blue waters were breathtaking.\n\nOur last day in Florence was most excellent also.  We had Gaia as our food guide through Oltrarno.  We had such a good time with her and learning about the foods of Florence. And we all ate Lampredotto!  Paul and Jeff wanted to go back there for a late lunch. After that tour, Paul and I continued on walking tour through Oltrarno ourselves, ultimately making our way back over the river to the Uffizi. After that, although our feet were killing us, we went back over the river to Piazzale Michelangelo for the sunset view of Florence :D  AMAZING!!  \n\nJeff and Julie went to San Miniato for some Gregorian chants and made it for the sunset also.\n\nIt was an AMAZING trip that you and your Italian cohorts created for us.  We were so amazed at the architecture, the countryside, the food, the wine and the people.  Just a beautiful country all around.  AND just so you know, I don't think we missed a day without gelato and my favorite was chocolate orange from Gelateria della Passera in Oltrarno.\n\nJulie, anything to add?\n\nAgain thank you Teri and Trips2Italy for all your help in putting this amazing 25th anniversary trip together for us.  I will definitely recommend you!!\nKelly G. - Travel Agency's Client","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/4","location" => "Apex, NC"],

Most everything about it.\nHotel Rapello was very nice and I would recommend it to anyone.  The staff was great, the room was nice.  We walked soo much that when walking back to the hotel was a bit tiring.  Not too bad but it may be slightly better to stay closer to the city centre.\nHotel Quiranale was a very nice hotel. Room was nice.  Very ornate lobby and surroundings.  Breakfast was a buffet that I would say was just fair.  I liked Hotel Rapellos breakfast better even though quite a bit smaller. I think we would have preferred the hotel to be closer to the Forum/Coliseum area.  As with in Florence, once we got back to the hotel it was a long walk back to areas we tended to want to be. i.e. Trastevere. Don’t get me wrong here, we enjoyed the hotel and had a great time.  We just ducked into small streets and found great Trattorias and restaurants.  Had lots of great food and wine in Rome and Florence. \n\nThe bus tour out to Tuscany was great.  Siena, Pisa were all great to see.  In addition we stopped at this winery for lunch that was fantastic.  Glorious view of the country side and good lunch with wine.  The tours in Rome were good too although tiring.  The Vatican was amazing and I’m glad we went early as by the time we left it was very crowded.\n\nThe tour to Pompei was OK.  Of course, the ruins are so well preserved and that was amazing.  I would have like to skip so much time in Naples however.  The lunch was fair at best and the guide was not the best either.  He went off on his political views on the bus and he really wasn’t that personable.  It was too big of group as well which makes it hard to “shepherd” them all.\n\nThe ancient Roman buildings and ruins just blew me away.  There are just so much of them around.  We also took a Segway tour on out last day that was a lot of fun.  We had a positive recommendation form a group on our food tour.  You might think about including those as options for future clients.  We went all over and didn’t have to walk!\n\nThe food tour in Florence was good.  The young man that was the guide was enthusiastic and it was fun see that part of Florence. i.e. “across the bridge”.\n\nThe food tour in Rome was excellent.  Very good guide and went to interesting places.  We went to a restaurant that had a wine cellar that was originally used by the Romans.i.e. 2.000 years old.  We had wine and a nice meat dish in the cellar.  It was the highlight of the tour.\n\nI could go on as we saw soooo many things and had so many eating experiences.  Overall it was a fantastic vacation.  Thanks for putting it together for us.\n\nTake care Emily.\nBob V.","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/4","location" => "Houston, TX"],

Over the course of the 7 days we spent our time well with the activities helpfully honed by Tommaso tailoring exactly what was needed to make out experience a memorable and well spent time abroad. His inclusions to experiences we asked about and some we'd never have known about were thoughtfully planned out and required zero effort on our part to make it happen. Tommaso and his team took care of every detail for us, the relief of the stress in planning being removed was the best part of the service of Trips2Italy. The professionalism of what was going on behind the scenes is thoroughly appreciated and not overlooked. We'd use their assistance the next time we go to Italy for sure.\n\nA sure highlight of the trip was the train ride into the Swiss alps aboard the Bernini Express up to St Moritz, Switzerland. Literally hanging out of the window with camera in hand, a bad photograph quite simply could not be taken. The scenery and experience overall was breathtaking. Other key highlights were the private tours of the 2 main cities we decided to stay in. Group tours are convenient but when it comes to really getting a tailored experience having Tommaso and his team compile private tours of the two main cities we travelled to was a once in a lifetime experience. We can't give enough praise to his team for allowing us to have a wonderful time with no worry as to how or where things would come together.... they thought of it all. The most amazing highlight was unplanned and totally unexpected. Tommaso and his team made available a bottle of prosecco and bowl of olives to help me celebrate my 50th Birthday, sent up by the hotel we stayed at and quite literally left me speechless. The thoughtful and kind gesture was what separates a company like Trips2Italy from any we have encountered before.\n\nI can't think of anything we'd do differently for that particular trip but with Tommaso and his team at our backs, I can imagine there are many adventures left to be had that are new and exciting. There are no regrets or what if's, this trip was exactly what we needed to recharge our inner batteries and look forward to our next adventure.\n\nMarie and Michael V. - Port Tobacco, MD","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/4","location" => "Port Tabacco, MD"],

We had the best tour guides in each city that made our tours meaningful and we learned so much. The food was fabulous and the tours expertly run. We certainly made special memories in each location. Rome was also a great experience and we took away exactly what we were hoping for in once in a lifetime opportunities.\n\nOur trip was amazing and where TJ and I both agree we would not change any of it, we both think that next time (depending on where we go) there are two things we would consider doing differently. The first would be only direct flights. We connected on the way to Italy and it made the travel so much longer. Overall, the travel experience with the airlines was smooth but it added a great deal of time to travel to Italy. That said, we only had the option for connecting flights out of Boston so we might reroute ourselves next time to fly direct. Secondly, for any trip over a week, we will book hotels that offer spa and fitness services. We both agree if we are going to be away from home more than a week these are important to us. We had these services available at our first hotel in Lake Como and it was wonderful! It simply allowed us when we want to take a break and come back to the hotel to relax to have some options besides sitting in our room.\n\nYour lake was our favorite part!

Our stay at Poggio Alloro in San Gimignano was perfect - the staff was so nice and helpful, the accommodations were great, the food was delicious, and the views were amazing. San Gimignano is a beautiful medieval village and our favorite out of all the others we visited. \n\nThe Brunello and Chianti wine tours were so much fun, our drivers were great, and we met so many people from all over the world. Of course, the wine was exquisite and we can't wait to get our shipments. I had a blast driving around in our convertible Fiat - scary at first but then I got the hang of it. We had a free day to drive around Tuscany and we stumbled upon an adorable village called Certaldo. We then drove through the countryside to Greve in Chianti. \nThe other villages/cities that we visited were Siena, Monteriggioni, Montalcino, and Castellini in Chianti.The last few days of our trip was in Florence. Wow, what a city. Our first day we got in 28,000 steps! That's because we walked the entire city center, took the 414 steps up and down the Bell Tower, and climbed the stairs to Piazzale Michelangiolo to see that notorious view of Florence. \nThe Discovering Florence walking tour on the second day was great because we saw many things we didn't see the day before and learned the history of the city, buildings, and much more. We also visited the Cathedral, Duomo, Baptistery, Duomo museum, Mercado Centrale, Uffizi Gallery, Accademia, Boboli Garden, walked over the Ponte Vecchio many times, and much more.The food, let me tell you, was heavenly. I tried wild boar for the first time, shared a 2 lb. Florentine steak with my husband, discovered that I love liver pate, truffle oil, and limoncello! Oh and the gelato, yum!\n\nThanks for making our trip to Italy so amazing. \nIt was a dream come true and an experience of a lifetime.Sincerely,\n\nMya & Brian Burke","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/5","location" => "Salina, KS"],

Upon my return from our trip to Italy,  I got very busy at work. I now have time to focus on composing a letter that, I hope, relays how perfect our trip was. \n\nIn the age of computers, online services, instagramming and texting, one can lose hope that all forms of personable service and hospitality have become a thing of the past. Trips2Italy is proof that one on one customer service is still the key to creating special, memorable moments. \n\nI still recall, as if it were yesterday, when I first called you inquiring about a trip to Italy. I told you I was traveling with my 3 nieces and 1 nephew and what cities I wanted to visit.  I told you I needed someone to book all my travel including planes, trains and automobiles and I preferred private short tours to get familiar with the cities and then explore on our own. Without hesitation, you took me under your wings and arranged, what has become, my favorite vacation ever!  \n\nEven when we were faced with one of my nieces possibly not coming and having to change around reservation options you all were constantly there for me, my questions and my concerns. \n\nOff we went!  Venice first for 2 nights. The water taxi, as arranged, was there to take us to the city when we landed. We were greeted at Hotel Da Bruno, by very pleasant, helpful staff. We were checked in immediately and given maps of the city. The following day, we met with our tour guide. Again, at the exact location and time you arranged for us. She was lovely. Our walking tour was great. Your advice to schedule a gondola ride when we got there was the way to go. The hotel called a reputable gondolier and they walked us over to meet him. It’s beautiful to see the city from the water. \n\nThe speedy train you booked for us to get to Florence the following morning left right on time. Your detailed information was right on point! \n\nHotel Rapallo would be our home for the next 5 nights. You arranged our day trips to Cinque Terre one day, Lucca another day, and a day trip with a private driver (who the kids loved) to take us through Tuscany where we stopped in San Gimignano (we loved this little quaint town) and Sienna and a walking tour of Florence along with tickets to the Accademia Gallery. All of it.....WOW. \n\nThe staff at hotel Rapallo were exceptional!  I have been in the hospitality industry for over 25 years. Bar none, the service we received in both hotels was the best I have experienced to date. That is saying a lot. I am 51 and have been to 33 states and 20 countries. I travel quite a bit and simply loved Hotel Rapallo!  \n\nEmily, all the private tour guides were on time. They were passionate about their cities and so knowledgeable. But most importantly, they were story tellers who engaged my family, ages 13-22, in a manner that left them excited and involved. \n\nThere was not a beat skipped. Your booklet of information was exceptional. When I indicated to you I would not be able to have the 2 hour consultation you have with your clients after we receive the packet, you were willing to explain everything to my 22 year old niece. \n\nThis trip was intended to just be for me. However, I decided to invite my family along and to see their joy and happiness at every turn throughout the trip was a blessing I will never forget. \n\nI can go on for days and maybe even write a book of it, but the bottom line is this:  It was PERFECT!  I hope you continue to partner with the same people in Italy for years to come. \n\nI don’t want to end without saying how you, Anna and Tommaso were on hand even when we were in Italy. When I wanted to insure that my return flight tickets were upgraded on the return flight, Tommaso was right there for me even with the time difference and your responses were so quick. \n\nThere are no words to describe the beauty of Italy and all the enchanting cities we visited. Cinque Terre on the coast was exactly like the pictures. The ferry and train took us to different villages that our guide seamlessly navigated us through. \n\nAMAZING. PERFECT. BEAUTIFUL. \n\nPlease,  Emily use any of this on your website or all of it. You are a gem. By chance, are there other countries you book travel to?  Might want to take the kids to Ireland and Scotland next. \n\nAgain, all our gratitude to all of you. I cannot stress enough how seamless everything went and I’m willing to talk to anyone about it that you need me to!  So much we saw during the day and evenings that I haven’t even mentioned like the gardens at Pitti Palace in Florence and please add the restaurant Mamma Gina to your list in Firenze. Fantastic!  \n\nI know I’m missing so many more details but we really felt at home wherever we went and with all the people you arranged for us to take care of us. \n\nYou’re the best!\n\nMay our paths cross again soon.  \n\nBest regards for now. \n\nLulu","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/6","location" => "Springfield, VA"],

The drivers and guides were top notch.  Especially our first driver, Roberto in Apulia.  \nHe was very professional and extremely nice.  We hated to have to give him up.  All the drivers were on time and professional.  Even when driving without a guide, our drivers usually gave out information as we went along.\nThe included meals were fantastic .  \nWe really  enjoyed the lunches and the welcome dinner restaurant was really great.   \nThe lunch at L'astore farm and winery was very memorable.  The owners were extremely gracious and the food and wine were outstanding.   \nThe cooking school and pizza making experience will be a lasting memory.  The lady who was our host was wonderful.  She was not only warm and gracious, but had a spontaneous flair that was endearing.  She fit the part of a warm Italian mother/cook more that we could have imagined. \n A great experience with tasty pizza and wine as well.  Not to  mention her  homemade Limoncella.          \n\nLoved everything we saw.  All the guides were knowledgeable and spoke excellent English.  \n\nWe enjoyed all the hotels.  They were all very pleasant with good breakfast and nice rooms.  They were also in great locations in relation to the city center and tourist  sites.  The hotel in  Sorrento was especially memorable.  First, it was in a great location.  Just a few steps from the main activity street of  restaurnats/shops.  Our room with a balcony overlooking the bay was really great. We spent some every evening on the balcony having a glass (or more) of wine listening to the surf and watching the lights across the bay.  Even the bar, with its ocean terrace   was special. We aslo enoyed the front garden with pleasant seating areas.    Can’t imagine staying anywhere else.  \n\nNow for the only negatives:\nFirst, the Pompeii visit was way too short.  This is such a significant historical site that I think at least four or more hours are needed for the visit.  Actually I could have spent an entire day there.  Two hours were just not enough time to see much and I think we missed some important parts of the site.\nAlso, for us, the cave tour was not very interesting.  It might be that we have seen other caves here in the U.S. It was a long a difficult walk and did not seem as impressive as we thought it would be   I understand it is an important site in that part of Italy and other people might really enjoy it,  IN hindsight, I would probably have preferred to visit another village in the area instead.\n\nDespite these two items, let me say again that it was another job well done by you and your staff.  As I stated above, the trip was fabulous.  \nI tell anyone that is thinking to going to Italy that they need to get with you.   Everything was so well done that all we had to do was enjoy ourselves. Which we did!!\n\nJohn","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/6","location" => "Houston, TX"],

The hotel was easily within walking distance but having him meet us knowing exactly where to go with the bags was great.When we were leaving Venice we encountered a group of ladies struggling with pulling their bags up the steps that go over the canals and one of them looked at our porter easily maneuvering his cart up the steps and said to me..”what were we thinking?”.

When a delay of our flight in Omaha caused us to miss our connecting flight to Rome, I notified Trips2Italy and they adjusted the time of the airport transfer with no problems. \n\nSecond, the people at the Columbia Hotel were very nice and helpful. We enjoyed the breakfasts very much. The room was adequate. We availed ourselves of the rooftop lounge a few nights.\n\nThird, the various tours:\n\n--The tour guide for Ancient Rome was very knowledgeable and we learned a great deal. I think she was thorough and friendly.\n--The tour guide for the Jewish Ghetto and Trastavere was outstanding. We were the only two on the tour and she was quite knowledgeable and intelligent. We had a wonderful time. After the tour was over, we had lunch in the Ghetto and then did a tour of the Great Synagogue.\n--Overall, we really enjoyed Rome. The city is very pretty. We spent our free time exploring the city, shopping, and eating (lots of eating!). We also did a tour of the Christian Catacombs and went to the Trevi Fountain at night. We took in some opera, too.

After spending hours and hours of time planning our own trip to England and France two years ago, this was a much better experience. I can't even say I saved money planning my own trip because I didn't know enough information about what to do when. Your quote I thought was very reasonable and the tours were of the finest quality. The hotels had such interesting history and they couldn't have been in a better location. We loved both Hotels!\n\nThe private transfers from all of the drop-off points were very reassuring and the guys couldn't have been nicer. They all were dressed professional and made us feel special.\n\nThe tour guide at the Colosseum and Roman Forum was great, including the guide, Davide at the Vatican. The most interesting tour was Pompeii, but mainly because I was not as familiar with the history. The most beautiful tour was the boat ride over to Capri. There wasn't any snorkeling offered but we did go swimming directly by the cliffs of Capri. The tour of the Amalphi Coast was good but the traffic was the worst. It might have been the rain that was the most contributing factor to the long lines of traffic. It made the tour much longer than expected. The only suggestion I'd like to make is the tour times for the Colosseum and the Vatican tour were much longer than three hours. The Vatican was over 4 hours. The main reason I mention this is that we had Italian friends meeting us on both days and they had to wait a long time for us to finish our morning tours. We didn't want to have to leave the tour early, but we felt badly that we had told them that we would join them after the three hour tours.The best tour of all was visiting the lemon, olive oil, and cheese farm and making the pizza. It was the best pizza I had ever tasted! My husband gained seven pounds from eating the most delicious food in Italy. This tour ran over 4 hrs. I enjoyed all the tours, I just think the times may need to be changed in the tour booklet.Overall I'd say after visiting over ten countries , this tour was the best, yet. \n\nEmily, you gave such detailed information over the phone each time we talked that it made me feel very comfortable about the preparations for our trip.

They had a user friendly website and it outlined their\nExpertise in conducting Italian trips. I was immediately impressed. I sent an enquiry to their email address. I received prompt response from Emily Martolini. \nThen for about couple of weeks we went back and forth with requirements and suggestions.\nFinally I was satisfied with the itinerary. I had some difficulty with booking payment owing to foreign remittance.\nEmily was very patient and helpful all the way through the payment process.\n\nTwo weeks prior to our departure , Ana contacted us through email with travel vouchers, coupons and train schedules.\nEverything was well documented and systematic. All my doubts and concerns were addressed as necessary.\n\nThe trip itself was amazing in many ways. The clock work like planning by Emily and her team made the trip even more Memorable. There were no delays or lags. The pick ups were on time, the tour coupons were informative and self explanatory.\n\nThe chosen tour guides were well versed with the Italian culture and they shared many facts and inside stories about the various Historical sites. The highlight of our Rome leg was the Colosseum. It was spectacular. Vatican was breath taking as well.\nAt the Roman forum, crowd was excessive. But our guide was smart enough to sneak us through the rear entrance. It saved us a lot of time and energy.\n\nThe train journey from Rome to Venice was pleasant and comfortable. Venice was amazing. It was freezing cold when we reached there, but Emily had advised us in advance to carry winter wear.  So we were saved. ðŸ˜Š\n\nWe were late for the Doge’s palace group tour. The ferry was delayed due to rain. I immediately contacted Trips2Italy and they promptly rescheduled the tour to the next day. Highly appreciate such a gesture.\n\nSt. Marks basilica and Doge’s palace were beautiful. The Bridge of Sighs was touchy. The Gondola ride was magical to say the least. Thankfully the weather held up pretty well on Days 2 and 3. The Island tour with Murano, Burano and Torcello was pretty good. The ferry was outstanding. \n\n The train journey from  Venice to Rome was comfortable and on time. The next day our pick up arrived on time and dropped us off at Rome airport.\n\nIn Rome we stayed at Hotel Columbia twice. Once for 2 nights and once for 1 night before departure. On the first occasion the room allotted was very small. That room will suffice for solo travellers. However for couples I suggest allocate bigger rooms. We had limited space for our luggage. We informed Trips2Italy about this.\n\nThey promptly arranged a bigger room for us the next time. Highly appreciate it. The food at the hotel was very good.They helped us with our sight seeing too. Very cordial and friendly staff. Rooms were well maintained and air conditioning was also Good. \n\nIn Venice we stated at Hotel Carlton on the Grand Canal. It was right across the train station. We got a nice room with a beautiful view of the canal. The breakfast was extensive and well prepared.

We have been busy getting settled back into our trip.  Congrats and I hope you had a good Honeymoon!!!\n\nWe had a great time in Italy.  It was definitely a trip of a lifetime and all of our friends and family were very jealous.  We couldn’t have asked for better weather while we were in Italy (perhaps maybe not so hot).  The whole trip went very smooth and we didn’t have any issues finding where we needed to be, etc.  \n\nAfter landing in Italy we navigated to our water taxi and soon after got our first glimpse of Venice.  We soon checked into our hotel and quickly started our exploration of the city.  While in Venice we enjoyed eating a many good places!  We had squid ink pasta and good wine at Vino Vino, had a great lunch at Vino Vero in Cannaregio and probably our best dinner in Venice was at a little place that I can’t remember the name of in the middle of the city ;-( . \nI will find the name of it and let you know!  We enjoyed just walking around the city and taking in the beauty.  We attended Sunday morning mass at Saint Marks Basilica which was a very neat experience!  We enjoyed learning about the history of Venice and seeing the grand craftsmanship during the Doge’s Palace tour as well.\n\nAfter arriving to Florence by train one of our first stops was Trattoria Mario’s to split a Florentine Steak!  We were sat with a very nice German couple who made for good conversation to go along with a tasty steak.  That afternoon we enjoyed a walking tour of the city and capped it with a sunset from the Piazzale Michelangelo.  While in Florence we did a Tuscany day tour.  Our favorite stop on the tour was San Gimignano, where we had time to tour the city on our own and purchase a bottle of wine to enjoy as we sat on the city wall overlooking the Tuscan hillside.  The next day we did the Cinque Terre day tour; I think this was our favorite stop of our whole trip.  We would love to come back and spend more time in the park in the future.  I hope it is able to keep its charm and not change too much with the influx of tourist! \nOur final day in Florence we were able to tour the Duomo and see all the priceless art in the Uffizi Gallery.\n\nBy the time we go to Rome we felt like we had already seen so much!  Nevertheless there was plenty more to see in Rome.  The Vatican tour was such a neat experience and one we will always talk about and cherish.  The amount of history in Rome is hard to fathom.  We very much enjoyed our ancient Rome walking tour, esp. the Pantheon and the Colosseum.  I can’t say enough about our guide for the walking tour, she was spectacular!  I can’t remember her name but she was South African and had been living in Italy for many years.  Her knowledge was amazing.  On our final day in Italy we ventured over to Trastevere and we are very glad that we did!\n  It was great walking around the ancient streets and eating gelato and fried artichokes!  \n\nWe will miss the atmosphere, café, food, people and the scenery of Italy until we can make it back again!  \nI included just a few pictures of our many pictures from the trip.\n\nI would really like to thank you and everyone at Trips2Italy for making the trip such an easy and enjoyable experience! \nI would definitely recommend you to anyone looking to go to Italy!\n\nCiao e Grazie!!!\n\n-Lance & Katie","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/7","location" => "Gallatin, TN"],

Marco was the driver/guide for Amalfi coast, The Boat crew for the Capri boat trip, Simona in Pompeii, and tour group in Rome. We had the same guide, Serena, for both the Colosseum/Roman Forum and Catacombs tour, and she was excellent. The Vatican tour was good as well - could've used another hour on the tour, but then again time is limited and there's too much there anyway. You have good connections with these tour providers.\n\nAs far as hotels, the one in Sorrento was lovely - the place is clean (and had nice towels and plenty of soap and shampoo), the people are nice and the breakfast is excellent. It was also in a good location. \n\nThe hotel in Rome, however, was a bit lacking. The location was ok, the rooms were larger than in Sorrento, and the staff was friendly enough. However, they really skimp on services. Our individual complaints seem minor but taken together they show a hotel management that doesn't care about guests, only about saving money. The rooms aren't too clean - ants come into the rooms through the small terrace outside (so no proper bug spraying); the bathrooms were not thoroughly cleaned each day; the towels were thin; the shower curtains were terrycloth (I've never seen that in any other hotel) so they were always damp and musty-smelling; the plastic shower curtain liner in my daughters' bathtub wasn't long enough so the first time they showered water leaked out of the bathroom and into the foyer (then we had to put the terrycloth shower curtain into the tub to prevent the water from getting out); and we had to ask for additional soap bars. They had liquid bath gel/shampoo combination, which isn't good for either a shower or a shampoo. The breakfast room was noticeably understaffed, given the number of guests staying at the hotel. \nOverall, it didn't detract from our enjoyment of Rome, but for your future bookings you may want to check further on this particular hotel. It needs to be managed by people who aren't looking to cut corners. \n\nWe enjoyed everything on the trip so it's hard to pick a favorite thing, but the highlights for my daughters were the Blue Grotto/boat ride and the Colosseum/Roman Forum tour. The food was excellent and they had gelato every day. We also tried a few of the restaurants suggested in your tour materials. \n\nThanks again for arranging this tour.

I cant say enough great things about the locations you picked out, the hotel rooms, and even the fine details of what kinds of views our rooms had. We also really appreciated the small touches like the Champagne and treats at each of our hotel spots. No small detail was gone un-noticed. It truly made the world of a difference in our experience! \n\nWe absolutely loved Italy!!\n\nLake Como is hands-down our favorite. We hope to return there again someday. Possibly for an Anniversary trip? :) We hope to spend more time in Como, but also explore some of the other sides of the lake when we return. \n\nWe loved the Itinerary. For never going to Italy before, it's hard to know what we would like/dislike, but I think Andrew and I are on mutual agreement that we could have done without Milan. While we appreciate the history, I think we could have stuck to just Florence and Rome for the \"city\" vibe of our trip. We absolutely loved Lake Como (Like I said) and all of our experiences in Tuscany. I wish we would have done more food tours, similar to the ones we did in Rome, but again, thats not something we could have known without going through the experience. It was cool to eat like a local, and go off the beaten path of tourist spots. We could have also skipped the Vatican. Although it's a one-in-a-lifetime thing to see, we aren't particularly religious people, so the significance of it was sort of lost on us. It was great to see the sistine chapel while we were there though. That, I would recommend. \n\nWe stuck to your planned itinerary for the entire trip, which was exceptional. We do not feel like we \"missed out\" on anything in Italy. With that being said, the schedule was so jam packed that we really didn't have a lot of leisure time to wander the streets, with the exception of 1 day in Como, 1 day in Siena, and our last day in Sorrento. While we feel like we got the most \"bang for the buck\" with our itinerary, I think we both under-estimated how jam-packed our schedules would be and I think we both agreed that we would have toned down the tours a bit if we were to do it all over again. Again, with that being said, we learned a lot in each place we went and having a guided tour did help us make the most of the time we had in each city, because it showed us what to spend our time on and what to skip. So, I suppose its a catch-22. We certainly feel like we had an incredible experience and each day we learned something more and more valuable to take back and share with our friends and family. \n\nWe have a few more friends getting married soon and considering planning their honeymoon. I have already recommended you to one of our couple friends. I cant imagine NOT going through a planner like you for such a trip, and we wished you did trips like this for other countries too! \n\nThank you again for all of the time, effort, details and special touches you put to making our Honeymoon simply incredible. Your Italy is certainly beautiful, and we feel that you helped us experience it in the best way possible. \n\nThank you again!! \n\nKate & Andrew S.","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/8","location" => "Laguna Niguel, CA"],

The vouchers worked perfectly in every case. It was no trouble at all finding all of the meeting places. Every service provided was of good quality. \n\nIn Venice, we toured the Doges Palace and learned what was done in order to establish law and order in Venice. We also toured St. Mark’s. Though it was cold and pouring rain, it was worth it. Restaurant Osteria Al Milion, San Giovanni Christiomo, 5841 has quintessential Venetian charm, a welcoming attitude, warmth, excellent cuisine, and service. \n\nIn Rome, we toured the City, the churches, the Vatican, and the catacombs. Per your suggestion, Restaurant 34, was excellent. We didn’t know we should have reserved, but were offered a table anyway and received excellent service. The Tagliolini with clams was very yummy. It was fun to watch the waiters buzz around to all the tables patiently, yet with that Italian flair, explaining the dishes in both English and Italian. We walked miles and miles in the daytime and evenings to explore the history and were awed by the cultures of both cities. \n\nWe had many favorites…of which is The Hotel Columbia, which abounded in charm, including a chandelier in our room trimmed in beautiful Murano Glass. The service was exquisite. Both hotels were centrally located, so everything was within walking distance. The timing and quality of our tours (all told, we took five) was convenient and the information presented was understandable, and questions were answered knowledgably and enthusiastically. The Hotel Columbia comped us a basket of fresh fruit for my husband's birthday, which was a very nice surprise. \nThank you, also for gifting us the bottle of champagne to help with our celebration. ðŸ˜Š \n\n One of the first impressions was the seemingly endless graffiti defacing the exteriors of buildings all along the train route between the two cities and in many places within the cities, which detracts measurably from Italian charm. An equal, if not more-so a detraction is the pervasive, invasive smoking that goes on in public areas. We were not able to enjoy our meals while seated at table outside of the restaurants for this reason. The only other downside is the aggressiveness of street vendors, who should, likewise be outlawed or at least restricted. \n \nNone of these downsides have a thing to do with the service we received from Trips2Italy.\n\n We will ask for your services again in the future and enthusiastically recommend you.

You did a great job planning everything for us to do.  Our driver, Franchesco, was wonderful and so personable.  He never stopped smiling and laughing and was so knowledgeable about everywhere we went and we were all sad to see him go.  I told him if he's ever in Houston he will have a place to hang his hat and we will show him our city.  \n\n All of us thoroughly enjoyed the Saturnia Resort and wished we had more time there.  Between the sulfur springs, Turkish bath, sauna and waterfall I swear my wrinkles disappeared!  It was so relaxing to see everyone walk around in a robe all day until dinner! \nI could kick myself for not making a massage and facial appointment when I had the chance because they were totally booked with no open appointments for anything, but that's my fault and I won't let that happen next time and I hope there will be a next time. The dinner that night was exquisite and the service was impeccable! We felt like we were part of the rich and famous..and it felt good! \n\n Our hotel in Sienna, the NH Hotel Excelsior, was in a decent location and was quite nice with a large room and bathroom.  We enjoyed our tour of the town and leisure time to venture out on our own.  Each of the wineries were unique in their own way with all of the wine going down very easily.  They all served us food whether it be a snack or a meal and everything was fresh and delicious!\nAs we traveled from place to place none of us could get enough of seeing the beautiful Tuscany countryside and a picture just can't capture the magnificence of it. \nStopping at several of the small towns was just perfect giving us an insight of how the locals enjoy life.  It was impossible not to check out real estate ads just to see what our money could buy and boy it is a tempting thought to do just that! \n\n One of the highlights all of us extremely enjoyed was the hands on Tuscan cooking lesson.  The chef was so personable and showed us how to make a fabulous meal with such few ingredients.  I think every bit of food we prepared was eaten with no leftovers.  He had a friend come by who owned an organic winery nearby and we sampled all of his wines and he sent us back to the hotel with what was left in the bottles where we proceeded to finish them off in the hotel lobby while laughing and talking.  We drank a lot that night!\n\n The lunch prepared by the butcher was a definite experience.  The meat just kept coming and each one was better than the last.  I do have to say the Italians do like their meat on the rare side.  I would have liked it cooked a few minutes longer, but it all tasted good and it was entertaining to watch the cooks with their preparations.  The cuts of meat were something to see and we all left with our bellies full!\n\n Our hotel in Florence, Grand Hotel Villa Medici was very nice.  Our room and bathroom was newly remodeled with a nice contemporary style.  The hotel was in a convenient location although a few of the streets that led to it seemed a little seedy and deserted  to walk down at night.  After one night of that we figured out which ones to avoid and got around just fine. \nOur tour guide in Florence was very knowledgeable and it was obvious he loved what he did.  Our free time was spent exploring which included the Accademia, Uffizi and of course shopping in a shoppers paradise.  The market had changed quite a bit since I was there ten years ago, but I guess that's expected.  \nLots more immigrants now selling products from China which is sad and I understand why the officials are trying to make some changes to help improve the situation.  All of the Italian made pieces are so beautiful it's a shame to spoil them with items with not as good a quality.  \n\n Our farewell dinner at the Osteria Di Giovanni was a wonderful restaurant and the food was very delicious.  You planned a perfect farewell dinner for us and I thank you for that.  They even cooked one of our steaks medium rare and I couldn't get enough of it.  From start to finish it was perfect!\n\nThank you again Tommaso for planning a wonderful trip for all of us to enjoy and remember forever.  It was definitely a trip of a lifetime and we will have lasting memories of it forever.  You did a fabulous job planning every detail to perfection.  I would not hesitate at all to have you plan my next trip and will highly recommend you to friends and relatives.   A big thank you goes out to your staff as well as I'm sure all of this could not be possible without them.\n\n Hugs and Kisses, \n Sandy V.Tutto Bene Winery Group Tour","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/8","location" => "Houston, TX"],
    ["web-scraper-start-url" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews","title" => "Andrea & Vince W. - Italy Summer Family Trip ","content" => "Hello Tommaso,\nWell we made it back from Italy and had a wonderful time!  \nEverything went very well except for the small hiccup on the pickup at the Florence airport upon our arrival.  But that was resolved very quickly and everything else went like clockwork.\n\nOur first day in Florence was very casual.  We did walk around Florence and made it to the Accademia Gallery and saw the statue of David.  We also were able to see The Duomo and climbed the bell tower.  In the evening, the Pizza and Gelato class was fun with Chef Davide.\nThe next morning, the Vespa tour of Tuscany was wonderful and it gave us a feel of Tuscany and the beautiful countryside.\nWe had about 12 people in our group which turned out to be great.   We also ran into our Pizza making class Chef Davide during our Vespa tour. He remembered us and it was a nice talk to him again.  That night we happened upon one of our favorite restaurants called Da Pinocchio.  This restaurant was close to our hotel and the food was excellent and the staff at the restaurant was very friendly. \n Our day in Venice was good!  \nThe bullet train to Venice went very smoothly.  We loved the canals and the little alleyways with all of the shops and restaurant.  Our tour guide of the Doge Palace was very informative.  Although the tour of Doge Palace and the church was nice, we would have liked to have had more time touring the city of Venice with the guide, perhaps on the water or seeing Murano.  Also, it would have been nice to have known that we were going to go to a church that day so we could have dressed properly.  Instead we purchased several scarfs which were hot and uncomfortable.   At the end of the day we decided to walk back to the train station through Venice to enjoy the city further.  It gave us a better feel of the city outside of the tourist area of St. Mark’s Square.\n\nThe following day we loved the tour of Chianti and the medieval towns.  Our driver, Francesco, was wonderful!  In fact, he was our favorite driver/tour guide.  Although he was not officially a tour guide and did not walk with us during our stops, he was very entertaining in the car and was a wealth of information. \nHe was very interactive with the kids and they loved him too!  Francesco gave us the history of each town and its surrounding area, and also gave us tips on restaurants and town attractions.  One of our favorite towns was San Gimignano.  Francesco also brought us on a private winery tour with one of the winery owners who taught us about the local wines.  By the end of the day, Francesco was like one of the family!\nOur stay in Rome was amazing.  Although Rome is larger than Florence and Venice, it was amazing to see all of the ruins scattered throughout the city.  Our tour guide, Alisondra (sp?), was very good.  She turned out to be our tour guide for The Vatican also.\n  It was great to tour the Coliseum and the Roman Forum in which the kids had studied about and could relate to the history of these artifacts.Pompeii and Naples was amazing too.  We couldn’t get over how large the ruins at Pompeii were.   Our tour guide was very good and she showed us Naples also.  We were able have lunch at Sorbillo’s along the coast and taste authentic Neapolitan pizza.\n\nVatican City was also nice to see. \nOverall a fantastic trip!  Thank you and your staff for planning this wonderful trip.\n\nIn summary:\nAll of the tour guides were very good and professional.  Francesco was by far our favorite guide/driver followed by Alisondra.  All spoke English very well so we did not have any problems with communication.  Our driver the first two days in Rome spoke limited English, but that did not turn out to be much of a problem.\n  The Santa Maria Novella hotel in Florence was excellent.  Very good service, excellent breakfasts and they turned down our beds every night.  \nThe hotel in Rome, Sole al Pantheon hotel, was nice but older and had smaller rooms and spotty internet connection.  We had a room facing the square which was nice; however, we could hear the activities in the square until late at night.  We would definitely return to the Santa Maria Novella hotel.  However, we may try a different hotel in Rome next time.\n\nIt is hard to narrow down one specific thing we liked best, but the following would be high on our list:\n•\tPompeii (amazing!)\n•\tSan Gimignano (beautiful medieval town with shops.  Smaller town and not as crowded which was nice)\n•\tTuscany – tour of the countryside & winery visit\n•\tVenice (i.e. – walking the city – shops and restaurants)\n\nWe did try to go to two restaurants which you suggested in your information book.  However, due to the time of season, they ended up being closed.  That was a little disappointing and it would have been nice to know that they were closed beforehand.\nOverall we enjoyed Italy and would love to go back.  You and Ana were fantastic.  \nThank you for planning such a great trip!\nAndrea G. /Vince W. & Family","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/8","location" => "South Glastonbury, CT"],

Here are some notes I wrote to my son, Erik. It was truly a trip of a lifetime for me. I loved every minute of it. From the seamless travel of connections and drivers to the locations of the hotels. I will be a walking billboard for Trip2Italy. Thank you so much for everything!!!! It was a fantastic trip. Really, it was!!!\nNow back to the trip of my life time…..\nThis was my first tour into Chianti region. As you can see the rolling hills, the vines, and cypress trees. The lust green country side. This tour had about 30 people and was on a big bus. The kind I did not want to travel on but it only happened once. All the other tours was in small vans or cars. I picked one seed from the tree and now trying to grow it here. It’s got a sprout coming out of it and of course, it’s in an expresso cup. LOL\nIf a picture could say a thousand words. The right is a photo and the left is my painting of the roof tops. I love Siena and all its earthy colors!\nSiena is on top of hill and you can see for miles. I am thinking of painting the roof tops … thinking watercolors. You could see the lines of the city change over time as the walls of 1300’s to protect their fine city grew wider with time. I climbed a tower of the town hall that had over 400 steps up and 400 steps down. The stairwell was narrow and the steps were worn. Can you imagine what these steps could tell you about the history of the town of Siena. The wars, the joy, and sorrow of the town. The black plague was a big influence on the town. Generations were destroyed. \nVolterra, Alabaster mined there then Siena Again. \nSiena, since the age of the city has very narrow streets. Old fashion lanterns. One of the couples I met on my last wine tour were from Canada, St John Island. After the tour we went out to eat on one of these narrow steep alleys. Well, after tasting a number of glasses of wine. Here we sat at a restaurant that had outdoor seating. Tasha and I had Pici spaghetti with sheep’s guts intestines with a gravy sauce. It was quite good. Well after sharing a bottle of wine with them and the meal ended. I was starting to be effected by this steep narrow avenue. Our stools were cut to feel balance on the hill. I thanked them for the time together and excused myself. I was fine once I started walking back to my hotel. It was a wonderful day and evening but the feeling of falling down the hill. \nI think the best part ( besides the expresso, gelato, and wine, in that order) was meeting others from around the world. A number of Australians, Americans, English, Canadian, and Switzerland. Tasha and Steve was my first connection. \nThen came Sheila from Switzerland, and Liz from Baltimore. I spend a day with each of travelers and it made it much more enjoyable. We shared experiences and knowledge of the trip and day. I have still connections from Liz. I wrote to Tasha via email and no reply yet. They both might be still traveling. I think they were having a 6 weeks holiday.\nKathrina S. - Travel Time Agency's Client","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/9","location" => "Menphis, TN"],

What did you see and do while you were there? We visited the Vatican, (amazing!) The ruins, Pantheon and the Coliseum. Everything was so large and overwhelming (in a good way). We also visited Florence and saw the statue of David at the Accademia museum. So many fantastic sights to see, food to eat and shopping. \nWe loved everything about Florence the most. It was fascinating to experience the Italian lifestyle from the narrow streets, the little shops, the many, many restaurants and how they extended into the streets for seating. Amazed at the lack of driving rules like we have in America. I like Italy's rules much better. LOL \nAlso loved that there wasn't music blaring everywhere. We sat and watched people often and noticed that how quiet it was yet still full of sounds. It was the sound of people visiting, walking, quiet traffic and local musicians playing in the piazza's. It was delightful and quite relaxing. \nWhat did you dislike? Loved every minute of it.Just wanted to say thank you for making this the most enjoyable trip we've had. The treatment we received while in Italy from the hotel staff to the airlines was above and beyond our expectations. \nThe hotel staff at each hotel knew who we were as soon as we walked in the door and both hotels upgraded our rooms to ones with a private patio in Rome and a balcony in Florence.\n\nI had a wonderful birthday on top of the honeymoon and everyone treated us like we were the only people there. Even the airlines brought us treats form the first class section and all the crew (not the pilots) came by to congratulate us on our honeymoon. This was on the trip home as our seats were separated. Norm visited the ticket agent before we got on the flight to see about changing out seats so we could sit together and they went as far as paging other passengers and asking them to move seats. And people DID!! It was awesome!! We honestly had the time of our lives and can't wait to go back some day. There is so much more we want to see next time. \nThank you again for treating us so well and making sure our honeymoon was perfect. We will never forget it or you and Trips2Italy.

The hotel staff was awesome, friendly, informative helpful, etc… Naples: Another beautiful city and people. The tour guide was great. The restaurant wear we ate at were extremely friendly and accomodating, especially concerning my food allergies (I received a very nice because of it!) The food was tasty.  I just felt the tour of the city was a little short but I understood why.Pompeii: was breathtaking. It was surreal that I was actually IN Pompeii. The tour guide, again, very informative. She did an amazing job fitting all that history in a short amount of time. She gave us time browse the local shops…The country side is amazing!Venice: It was very nice. I did have a few mishaps in going to and in Venice. I actually missed my train going to Venice. I did not realize that there were no escalators or elevators in the train station, so struggling with my bags, I missed the train… Howver, once I was at the hotel. The staff was great. They were friendly, helpful, informative and recommended great places to eat…The day of my birthday, when I entered the lobby that morning, the hotel staff stopped what they were doing and wished me happy birthday! I could do nothing but blush and smile.  The manager(?), gave me a piece of cake. It was my second piece, as the night staff gave me a piece of cake as well, after midnight for my birthday. The staff was also a pleasure to talk to and recommened a local restaurant that I frequented when I was there. The manager also arranged for me to have a private tour (I think) to the glass making factory. I was amazed by the craftsmanship! I also received your birthday wishes. Thank you. The private wine tasting tour was amazing as well! They were very catering and the wine and food was great! I went on a gondola ride as well to end my birthday night.… Overall, it was a fabulous trip!... Thank you and your staff so much for making this an amazing trip!

Took an afternoon trip to Pisa.  Then went to Bologna to walk through the markets and have lunch and stopped in Padua.

I liked stopping in the towns for a couple of hours for a small tour and then some free time.  The tour was a good pace.  We kept busy the whole time.  Lucy,our tour guide, was an expert at knowing how much time to do everything - excellent pace.  It was an excellent tour!   I would highly recommend this tour to anyone who wants to get a good feel of what Tuscany, from Rome to Venice, is like.

Italy was amazing, I'm so glad we picked the places that we did. Each had it's own personality and we loved exploring them all.We loved walking around Venice, Burano is one of my favorite places in the world! It is so picturesque and adorable. We loved the Doge's Palace tour and walking through the Bridge of Sighs. We found amazing coffee house with live music and good food. The food tour in Rome was one of the highlights of our trip! The places we went to were so perfect and the tour guide (Anna) was amazing. It was such a great way to see the city, I would highly recommend it to anyone. The Vatican was of course incredible and we loved seeing the ruins and walking around. Our Pompeii tour guide (Francesco) was so passionate and informative. You could tell he really cared about his town and his tour, he had so much to say about everything. It was nice to have the private tour and I would continue to use him as a guide, he was really great. Sorrento had to be my favorite city we visited. The Hotel there was the best we stayed in, the view was incredible. The marina grande was so cute and just what we were looking for. The fresh food, gelato, shopping, just everything there was great. This town has an amazing vibe.The only disappointments were cancelled gondola tour but we did appreciate the customer service we received from your team around this. The transportation vouchers were great, everything went off without a hitch and everyone we interacted with was very helpful. It was really nice to not have to worry about cars, the timing, and the trains. It was really easy and well managed. Thanks for your assistance and your planning. It was an unforgettable trip! \"","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/10","location" => "State of Virginia"],

    ["web-scraper-start-url" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews","title" => "Dianne W.","content" => "\" Maria, Ana, and Tommaso:Thank you for a wonderful Italy vacation experience.  We all agreed it was our best vacation yet.  The total length of time was just right, as well as the time spent in Florence, Pisa, and the Cinque Terre.The flights over to Italy were seamless, with just the right amount of time in between the connections.  We were very pleased to sit together from Dallas to Amsterdam – so if you’ll changed our seating – THANKS!  The smaller plane from Amsterdam to Florence was fine to have split seating.The plane arrived on time in Florence. We had a short wait, as the driver arrived according to his paperwork, about 15 minutes after our arrival.  The Hotel Giglio personnel were very pleasant and accommodating.  This was a nice location and made for easy walking to the tourist sites.  The room was accommodating, and we enjoyed the breakfast foods. On Sunday, we really enjoyed the small group walking tour and the tour guide – who was very friendly and knowledgeable.  It was very nice to be in a group of about 8 people, instead of a large group of 30 or so as we noticed as we walked around.   It was a bit challenging to find the exact location of the tour guide office.  So, for your future clients, I recommend written walking directions from the hotel and/or a more detailed / close-up map on how to walk from the hotel to the office location.  We ended up asking the local police for directions.After the walking tour and lunch, we toured the Bargello museum and then the Accademia.  We had time to walk around, see some sites, and go back to the hotel to rest.  In the evening, we walked to the Michelangelo Plaza and ate dinner at a place on the lower deck, taking in the view of the city as the sun was setting.  Monday's Tuscany tour and wine tasting were lots of fun, and Kelly purchased some wine to ship home!Tuesday morning we opted to skip the Uffizi and instead toured the Pitti Palace and Boboli Gardens, and then the Duomo cathedral – all picturesque.The transfer from Hotel to train station, navigating the train station, and riding the train were pretty easy.Our arrival at Pisa, connection with the tour guide, storage of the luggage, and actual tour were perfectly timed.  We also really enjoyed the tour guide and her descriptions of everything. Thanks for arranging the climb of the Pisa Tower! The tour of the Pisa cathedral was also fascinating.  After the tour, we enjoyed having some time to take a refreshment break and then head back to the train station at a leisurely pace. The train ride to Monterosso Al Mare was easy too.  The Hotel Punta Mesco was easy to find, and in a great location!  The daily breakfasts were great too.  Your pick of this town and the hotel were superb.  We really enjoyed our free time here.  On Wednesday, we hiked between Monterosso and Vernazza, took some fabulous pictures, and then trained to the other towns for more touring, eating, and shopping.  Thursday and Friday, we enjoyed sunning on the beach, relaxing, and enjoying the town.Friday’s departure from Monterosso was good.  The hotel was extremely accommodating by offering us a guest bathroom / shower to get cleaned up before departing the city.  Again – a perfect place to stay here!We could have left Monterosso an hour or so earlier if needed.  Our arrival and stay in Genoa was OK, but we were glad we didn’t have any more time spent there. The big industrial environment, shipping port, etc. were not to our preference.  The Grand Hotel Savoia room was very nice.Our Saturday morning departure was early as planned, but I think we would have been OK to have left the hotel later, maybe at 6am instead of 5am.  The flight to Paris was fine.  However, the connection time to get to the Paris departure flight was very tight, and navigating from a smaller terminal via bus to a second very large terminal, and then walking to a third very large terminal and trying to find the Delta ticket counter was all a bit overwhelming.  Fortunately, a customer service representative recognized that we were overwhelmed, stepped up, and assisted us by moving us to the front of the line for a Delta agent to assign our seats and direct us to the security check-in lines.  It would have been better to have already had seat assignments and to have been able to check-in via internet the night before.  We rushed through the airport, and arrived at the gate which was already boarding passengers.  It seemed to us that we had ~5 minutes or so to spare before the plane doors closed.  We did get situated and enjoyed the flight back to Minneapolis.For future reference, I suggest travelling from Monterosso all the way to Paris the same day, and spend the night in Paris – assuming flight availability.  The next day, then transfer from the Paris hotel to the correct airport terminal for the flight home.  I think this would be a lot less hectic.Our arrival to Minneapolis was fine – although there was stormy weather.  We had plenty of time to have been on the earlier flight (3-3:30pm) to DFW, but that flight was already booked.  Due to the weather, our flight was delayed from 6pm to 11pm.  We arrived DFW airport ~ 12:15am on Sunday and safely home about an hour later.Again, overall, we had a GREAT vacation.  I really appreciate your patience through all of our planning questions, and your attention to detail for us to have such a wonderful experience.  I am already recommending your services to friends!Chow,  Dianne W. \"","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/10","location" => "Dallas, TX"],
    ["web-scraper-start-url" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews","title" => "Kathy and Walker B.","content" => "\" To Tommaso and the Staff of Trips 2 Italy,Our recent trip to Italy was fantastic. The Lake Como region is as beautiful as we imagined. On our boat trip we visited Tremezzo, where we spent time at Villa Carlotta in the spectacular gardens and toured the villa, followed by a visit to Bellagio, where we bought silk scarves from a local shop. While it was colder than we expected to start that morning, the afternoon sun warmed us and made for breathtaking views. We had the risotto and perch dish you mentioned in Como city - excellent! The trip on the Bernina Express and the return drive were spectacular also. The views were beyond our imagination. At the top of the mountains, it was actually snowing - a beautiful and pristine setting for two travelers from Houston who never get to see snow. After coffee in St. Moritz, we stopped for lunch in Chiavenna, and then a stop in Menaggio for gelato and a stroll around the village. Our time in Milan was too short to take in all that we saw. We enjoyed the bus tour, but had no opportunity to return to any of the places we saw, or explore further on our own. We did get a ride in the Maserati courtesy car to the Galleria. A beautiful way to see the streets and to arrive in style.Venice was such a beautiful Renaissance city. We loved wandering the narrow streets and browsing in the shops. The crowds in and around St. Mark's Square  made the tour of the Duomo quite challenging although we did enjoy it. After losing sight of the guide twice, and having difficulty hearing her in the large group, we left the crowd behind to enjoy a delicious and leisurely lunch at a trattoria near the hotel. We loved the Bacari tour, as there were only 6 people plus 2 guides. The small bars we stopped at were interesting and unique; the wines and snacks were wonderful. It was the perfect size gathering for us and a perfect ending to the week's adventure. We tried both the sardines and the cod specialties of the region and thought they were both excellent. We do apologize for the missed train station in Venice. We saw no distinction in the names of train stations, and it took time to understand what we did wrong, and where we went wrong, then buy tickets and try (unsuccessfully, twice) to board a train back to Venice. We could only think, on arriving in Venice, that both of us must have fallen asleep and not noticed the difference in where we thought we were supposed to get off the train. By that day, we were fairly exhausted from the other days of long tours and travel. We are sorry for any inconvenience we caused.  We did wave to the family in Colico, from the direction of Bellagio, and as we passed the signs on the way to Tirano. The hotels, and the staff at each of the hotels, were excellent. From 21st century to the 14th century, they were quite an experience; all were comfortable and accommodating. Our luggage did not make the connecting flight in Amsterdam, and arrived late afternoon on Monday, after our arrival on Sunday. While we missed having our warmer coats, it didn't stop us from quickly finding cappuccino and gelato in Como. The airline has been very prompt in responding to our claim for out of pocket expenses. We know with travel, these things can happen. It was a minor inconvenience, made better by a quick purchase of a couple of extra sweaters before going out on the Lake.Overall, our trip was fantastic, memorable and everything we wanted it to be. The down side is that now that we're home, there is no one to bring us cappuccino, and nothing to view except Houston traffic. After some time in the traffic, our thoughts will return to the idea of our next trip to Italy, and we will contact you again. Until then, we will continue to recommend your services to friends and family.Thank you very much for all you've done to create such a wonderful trip for us. Ciao!

    ["web-scraper-start-url" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews","title" => "Amelia and James S.","content" => "\"Dear Amber,I am forwarding the e-mail that I sent to friends upon our return from our wonderful trip to answer your question: What did you see and do while you were there? Then I will give you feedback about the Rome experience that you   planned  in such details. Jim and I just returned home from our Rome Adventure.  What a coincidence that the movie ”To Rome with Love” by Woody Allen was available on the flight to Rome.  Trips-2-Italy, a tour company based in Houston planned our tour of Rome which met my expectations.  We took in all the sights that I had learned about in Latin I and II---the catacombs, the Appian Way, Roman Aqueduct.  Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica was overwhelming.  I can hardly fathom that Michelangelo sculpted the Pieta with Mary and Jesus when he was only 24 years old.  And according to some critics he believed that the tomb of Pope Julius, which he never completed, was his best work.  The focus is Moses. The structure of the Pantheon, the best preserved Roman building, was fascinating.  Seeing the Trevi Fountain illuminated at night was mesmermizing.  In Miss Morrison’s English II class, I remember memorizing Shakespearean lines such as “And you, too, Brutus?” quoted by Julius Caesar and I was walking over the Roman Forum where this took place—WOW!  Finally we wandered thru the Colosseum and it is just that—colossal!We headed to the port to embark the Viking Star, one of cruisings’ most beautiful small ships. I now understand what the Viking brand is and I liked it!  We discovered the heritage(It was mindboggling how many countries had ruled each of the islands), culture, history and tasted typical foods of Pompeii, Sicily, Sardinia, Mallorca, Spain, and Valencia, Spain. We learned so much history and marveled at such scenic beauty.  We truly experienced Mediterranean Splendors!  Ciao. . . AmeliaReview of the Rome experience by Trips2Italy::From the time that your driver met us at the airport and transported us to the Hotel Columbia and picked us up again to take us to the port, your Rome plan did meet our expectations and more as I stated in the e-mail.  It was very comforting and secure feeling to have the same driver for all of the transfers.  He was very professional, friendly, and desiring of us to have the best experience possible.  He was so excited about the big cricket match taking place on Sunday, Feb. 14.  That way we learned firsthand how important cricket is in the six countries that were participating in the big match.We were very pleased with our accommodations and service that were so graciously provided by the full staff at Hotel in Rome.  They even wrote us a nice note wishing us a nice stay.  They would patiently give us directions and answer any questions.  We loved going upstairs to the patio for cappuccinos and a snack in the afternoon before heading out to another sight.We loved the walking/eating tour that Thursday night in Trastevere . We learned the history of Rome at the Tiber River.  It was a great way to sample many restaurants and the specialty foods that we otherwise would not have had the time to take in.  We liked going to the small homegrown restaurants that are still run by the same local families for generations that the  Romans choose to eat at.  A highlight was Spirito di Vino, which was formerly a Jewish synagogue before the Jewish were sent to live in the Jewish ghetto.  Another was Innocenti which had so many mouthwatering biscotti to choose from—an impossible task . Not as many visitors go on the Appian Way, Catacombs, Aqueduct excursion . But I am glad that we did, just for reasons I stated in my e-mail.  But I learned so much that made me understand the history of Rome’s commerce and the Christians in Rome. I liked seeing the frescoes, stucco work and graffiti engraved by the Christian worshippers even before the edict given by ConstantineTo see the mighty aqueduct system built by the Romans was amazing.  Then to learn that the barbarians destroyed  parts of the system to destroy Rome was very informative and mind-boggling.Friday afternoon we visited  Church of Santa Maria Maggiore and St. Peter-in-Chains church.  To see what Michelangelo considered his greatest work, the tomb of  Pope Julius II including  the famous statue of Moses was absolutely breathtaking!The highlight for us was the Vatican City Tour City tour.  Not having to wait in line, getting started very early, and missing the crowds made for a wonderful experience.  The very competent guide who sees educating tourists about The Vatican Museum, Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter’s Basilica as her passion made this excursion exceptional!Our last tour, Ancient and Old Rome, on Sunday morning before we were to be trasnsfered to the Viking Star, was very informative.  We just did not have as much time as we thought we would at The Colosseum and the Roman Forum. It was rushed.  Since the security line to get into the Colosseum was so long, we did not have time to actually do the Roman Forum part of the tour.As you can see, we were very pleased with all of the excellent  services that Enjoy Rome provided.  The guides are well educated, skilled in tour guiding, and passionate about the subject matter.  We liked the small bus and walking tours that were more intimate__ as if they were designed just for us.  I do not remember the names of our tour guides and driver, but if it is anyway possible, I would like for you to relay our very positive evaluations to their administrative directors for it is the tour guide that really makes a tour successful.Trips2Italy was highly recommended to me and I am highly doing the same to others.  I hope to write up this same email as an article and submit it to International Travel News so many more interested travellers will learn about you.

So we thank you very much for this!We loved the itinerary. We had enough diversity to keep us occupied in each city, every guide did a great job, the tours were easy to find, and they were all interesting. We tried to go a little of everywhere.

Feel free to share with Tommaso as you think best.Overall:  A+++Highlight:  completely unexpected fruit cake and champagne from you and Tommaso in Rome on our anniversary!  Thank you so much!  It made a very special day even more special!Comments:    1.  Trip over went smoothly.  For us, perhaps because we're tall, the economy plus seating was well worth the cost.  We arrived early, had no questions at passport control and customs wasn't open!  Waited about ten minutes for our driver and then a smooth drive to the piazza near the hotel because cars aren't allowed in the piazza in front of the hotel.    2.  Enjoyed the Rome hotel a lot.  Great location, great view, great windows that, when closed, really blocked out the sound from the piazza.  Staff was friendly and helpful, and breakfast had lots of variety and was good.  We'd gladly stay there again.    3.  Our private driver for the eight hour tour was wonderful.  He hit most of the places we wanted to see and offered a few great suggestions of his own.  In fact, all of our private tour guides were so great, we've decided that private guides are well worth the expense.  We'd recommend Rafael, Dace, and Marco to our friends.    4.  Both the Vatican Museum and Borghese Gallery were awesome.  Lines at Vatican were LONG, so having a reservation was awesome.  And of course Borghese requires reservations.    5.  All three train rides were on time and easy.  Our cars were full, and luggage space at a premium.  We'd travel by train again.  Our drivers to and from Siena were on time, courteous, and friendly.  In fact, our driver from Siena to Florence went off the direct route to take us to Piazza Michelangelo so we could get that wonderful view of Florence as our intro to Florence.    6.  Hotel in Siena was quaint, in a good location, and very nice.  We were glad for the extra room that having a suite provided.  The ladies who ran the place were very nice, and the breakfasts were quite good.  It was the only place that put a smiley face on Jill's cappuccino!  We'd stay there again.    7.   Dace was a terrific private guide.  Her English sounded English!  Her knowledge, enthusiasm, and willingness to answer our questions made the tour a great success.    8.  We enjoyed the group bus tour to Montereggioni, San Gimignana, and a winery.  The salesman at the winery was quite a showman...Luigi!  Our stops were too short and we felt rushed, but still worth doing!    9.  The hotel in Florence was very, very nice.  Great gym, breakfast, and room.  Staff was helpful, and view from room was great.  We'd stay there again.    10.  Marco gave us a wonderful private tour.  Gave new meaning to the word extrovert!  We loved him.    11.  Academia and Uffizi were must sees.  Having reservations was a must do...the regular lines were really long!    12.  The Vasari Corridor group walk was interesting and we're glad we did it...but wasn't at the level of the private tours.    13.  We did Piti Palace on our own and the rooms reminded us of Versailles.  Opulent!  Very much worth doing.    14.  Hotel in Venice was also quite nice with a great corner room overlooking the Grand Canal and a good breakfast.  The day clerk at the desk pushed tour tickets pretty hard.  We were happy not to be in the middle of all of the tourists and would stay here again...others might prefer to stay closer to St. Mark's, etc.  We just took the vaporetto!    15.  Of the private tours, this was the closest to very good rather than great.  The guide seemed a little distracted to begin with, then warmed up and we really enjoyed it.    16.  The Murano/Burano/Torcello group boat tour was fun.  Weather was good enough that we road on top.  Glass blowing demo was not much compared to others we've seen but showroom was interesting.  Burano was such a quaint little town.  And the walk in Torcello was nice.  Worth doing.    17.  The gondola ride was disappointing.  Our gondolier followed his buddy, and engaged in a non-stop yelling conversation with him for the entire trip.  He didn't talk with us at all.  While it was fun to see the buildings from water level, not much ambience.    18.  We took a cab from the Rome train station to the hotel.  The cab driver turned off his meter part-way there, and then charged us a ridiculously high rate.  I refused to pay it and gave him what seemed reasonable.  He didn't complain.    19.  On our own, we did a tour for the papal general audience.  Not worth it.  Should have just gone on our own!    20.  Driver was right on time to take us to the airport.  We got there over three hours before flight time, and it's good we did!  Stood in line for United's passport check, stood in another longer line to check in with United, stood in a longish security line, stood in a short passport control line, stood on a bus for quite some time until it took us to our gate area, after maybe 20 minutes stood in line to have ticket and passport checked by United to walk to the ground floor and board a bus for a drive to the plane where we slowly walked up the stairs to enter the plane!As I said, we had a really, really great trip.  Many memories to last a lifetime.  Logistics went so well it's easy to forget how much could have gone wrong.  Many thanks to you and Tommaso for a vacation we'll always remember with great fondness!

The logistics were spot-on and everything (drivers at airports/train stations, hotel locations, walking tours, wine tastings, museum reservations) went like clockwork without a hitch. The hotels were divine. My favorite was Hotel Palazzo Ravizza in Siena (the room was so spacious, the view was awesome, the outdoor terrace was an unexpected treat that we took advantage of several times a day, and the staff was very kind & helpful); although, the Hotel Santa Maria Novella (Florence) was a close second with its superb location, balcony, and wonderful breakfast buffet. But I also have to applaud the Hotel Columbia in Rome – we lucked out & got a room with a small outdoor patio that did wonders to cure our jet lag (as did your champagne; what a lovely & thoughtful gesture – mille grazie!). The staff at the Hotel Columbia was also outstanding and the rooftop terrace (for breakfast or an evening glass of wine) was delightful.Where do I start? We saw the beginning of civilization as we know it, we saw the birthplace of the Renaissance, we saw awe-inspiring art (how did they carve folds in material in marble and make it seem so lifelike and translucent??), and we saw some (a lot!) of the world’s greatest architecture. Actually, it was mind-blowing; I saw up close and personal places, buildings, and artists I’ve studied my whole life.The wine tastings/tours were a highlight and the ones you reserved for us were outstanding. I really enjoyed doing 2 small-group tastings and 2 private tastings as they were each so different and each so much fun. The Trastevere Food/Wine Tour was fun & enlightening (great tour guide) – small group tours are so enjoyable. We met locals as well as folks from all over the globe.The walking tours were very nice and gave us an overview of each city and its highlights in terms of history, landmarks, and local culture. The very best was the woman (Vivian? Valerie?) who led the tour of ancient Rome. She was an archeologist who had worked on one of the digs and she had the very best stories and really made Roman history come alive. Some of the tour guides’ accents (e.g., Florence, Venice) were hard to understand and follow.Of course, we walked and walked all day, every day. We appreciated the markets, sights, and restaurants you recommended. We roamed down side streets and out-of-the-way places and got happily lost several times – some of our best days!Liked the Most: My absolute favorite was Guglielmo Riggio who conducted our tour of medieval towns, Chianti, and San Gimignano. He was so personable, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable about history (local, Italian, and global!), art/architecture, and local culture. He entertained us non-stop for an entire day and I was sorry when the day ended. He was simply outstanding & I can’t recommend him highly enough!Disliked the Most: That’s difficult since I didn’t dislike anything for 2 whole weeks (bravo to you!). I think the most disappointing was the gondola ride in Venice. Our reserved evening was cancelled due to threat of rain, but they let us come back the next evening. Unfortunately the 45-minute gondola ride was only 15-20 minutes (at most); I don’t know if that’s the norm or if it was shortened because they had to make up for the night before. Overall, it was a superb trip and exceeded my expectations in every way. We very much appreciated your thoughtfulness in having champagne in our room, not just the first night, but the last night, too – such a nice, and totally unexpected, gesture. Finally, Nanci found Trips2Italy on the internet because we kept searching for an in-country group that would take care of all the arrangements (hotels, museum passes, wine/walking tours) and let us travel from city to city by train instead of plane. We had a hard time finding you, which is a shame as you and your group are so spot-on for what we wanted our trip to be. You listened & delivered – it’s almost like your read our minds! I’d be delighted to write a glowing recommendation of Trips2Italy if it would help spread the word about the fabulous service you offer.I can’t thank you enough for make my dream-retirement-vacation come true,Alison \"","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/11","location" => "USA"],

I had a critical week at work. In fact, the last 2 months have been very busy, mostly finding new projects for next year.The trip was fantastic. Your tours were quite well organized.The tour through the lakes was very good, particularly the guide Andrea - he deserves special complimenti -  who took us (not the whole group, only the braves) to the local restaurants both in Como, his hometown, and in Brescia. The boat rides included in this 4 days tour were a must.The hotels selection was very good, particularly in terms of location. The only observation was in regards to the hotel in Firenze: for us was not a big deal, but the staircase at the entrance may represent a hurdle for some people.The guided tour in Siena ended up being a \"private tour\": we ended up only the four of us with a guide who felt more comfortable in speaking Italian rather than English. And I was glad that Tatiana, Luis and Alice could follow it up.The tour to Cinque Terre was not so nice, but for reasons outside your control: the place was completely packed and, with the boats not running, the trains reminded me of my childhood in Brazil, going to school in a bus for 40 people carrying 120...Besides that, of course the place is fantastic, but I would suggest visiting Cinque Terre out of season peak.As you remember, the tours in Modena I organized by myself, but the hotel was very well located.The trains system was very nice: in time, clean, comfortable.Torino is a case apart. I think I will buy Lottery tickets until the day I win and can retire there. It is, for sure one of the most beatiful cities in Europe. The local guide knew every single detail of everything (se non era vero, era bene trovato...). Oh I should not have forgotten his name, but he was a musician from a group of medieval music. We could have spent hours talking about history, architecture, etc. All of us had two Bicerin, despite the heat.What we liked best: the cities, the monuments and their history,  the architecture, gelato, Chianti, Lambrusco, Parmiggiano Reggiano, Aceto Balsamico, Ferrari, Opera, Horse Meat, nature in the landscapes, the weather (we didn't have one day of rain),  the lakes, the people, steak fiorentina, grissini, tajarin....did I miss anything?What we disliked: coming back.Next steps: Ski vacation, Sardegna, Sicilia & Capri. One at a time, please, otherwise I bankrupt...Attached: some pictures of our trip. Unexplainable weight increase, as the trip goes by...If you need any of these in high res for your advertisement, website, etc please let me knowTanti Auguri,gli Berardi \"","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/11","location" => "The Woodlands, TX"],
    ["web-scraper-start-url" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews","title" => "Theresa and Marvin K.","content" => "\" Buongiorno Mr. Tommaso,I apologize for not answering your email sooner.  We returned with a terrible case of jet-lag from which we have finally recovered.  It is not as easy as we grow older.  Also have been busy catching up with mail, laundry, etc.Where can I begin?  Our trip was so wonderful.  Everything was planned so perfectly.  The drivers and tour guides were so helpful and professional.  They went out of their way to make our trip more enjoyable.  The hotels were so great and had wonderful breakfasts, clean rooms, helpful personnel, etc.  Except for the hotel in Bologna.  When we arrived, we were given a room that smelled so strongly of smoke.  We were told that we would be put into an interim room until another room was ready.  Marvin insisted that they put us into a permanent room immediately, which they did.  The room was acceptable but not quite as nice as the rooms provided in all of the other hotels.  Breakfast was very good there, however.  The hotel is not in the most wonderful location and a rather long walk to the center of town or restaurants.It is difficult to say which place  we liked the best.  Possibly Portovenere and Cinque Terre.  We loved Cernobbio and perhaps could have done without the free day there.  Had a great tour of Lake Como and a wonderful guide who went out of her way to take us into the town of Como to get a Tim card  for my telephone.  Loved Lake Maggiore and Isola Bella.  We had lunch at a great restaurant on Isla Pescatore..  While we were in Milan, we saw the Last Supper at Cenacolo Vinciano, visited the Duomo and also the museum at La Scala.  We really enjoyed the Eurostar to Torino.  Had no difficulty finding our train in Milan but the train station in Torino is very confusing.  Although we did enjoy the first class cabin.  Thank you for getting that for us.  We had a wonderful guide that first took us to a cafe to drink bicerin.  It was to die for. The following day, we took the underground to Expo.  It was so hot and crowded and was at least an hour wait to get into each pavilion.  We only went into one pavilion and then went to Eatily and had \"fried pizza\" which we had never heard of.  We were told that the best time to go to Expo is after 6 p.m.  They charge only 5  or 10 Euro (can't remember) and it is much less crowded.  The tickets actually cost 39 Euro but we got them for a little less at the hotel.  We really enjoyed Bologna.  Had a great guide and tour.  We enjoyed Ravenna.  Such a beautiful city and wonderful guide.  Especially enjoyed visiting Dante's tomb and the story of his life and death.  We especially enjoyed the tours of the Parmigiano cheese and the Parma ham factories and the wonderful lunch.  I never liked prosciutto before tasting it there.  We also enjoyed the visit to the balsamic vinegar of Modena factory.  Needless to say, we came home with a bottle of it and also a big hunk of Parmigiano cheese.  As I mentioned, we loved Portovenere and Cinque Terre.  Cinque Terre was on my bucket list!  Thank you so much for suggesting that we stay in Portovenere.  We love looking out our hotel room window at the Ligurian Sea and also at night, when the city is lit with lights.  Loved the wine tasting and will send you a picture if I ever figure out how to do it.  We especially loved the wines from that region and I am still kicking myself for not bringing home some of their regional pesto and olive oil.  We enjoyed Lucca and also the restaurant high up on the hill over Carara.  I was so happy that we added that to the trip.  Our driver from Portovenere to Rome was such a gentleman and went out of his way to show us the sights along the way.  He drove us through Lerice along the way.  What a lovely resort.  We also enjoyed Tarquinia.  What a good idea to stop there.  Our visit in Rome was a bit too long.  Originally we had planned to stay there only two days as we have been there many times before, and then go to Campobasso, where my grandmother was born, to visit relatives there.  As it turns out, they were on vacation and not available to see us this time.  We did take a short trip to Ariccia.  The palace was closed, so we had lunch there and headed off to find that road that is an optical illusion, but could never find it.  We drove to Castelgondolfo but it was so late in the day that we decided not to visit, and head back to Rome.  In retrospect, I  would choose to visit Castelgondolfo first and then go to Ariccia.  My distant \"cousin\" in Rome also has a company that takes groups on tours around Rome.  We were fortunate that he was able to spend two days with us during our visit and take us to some of the places that aren't so touristy.  He and his wife also took us to Tivoli gardens the day before we left.  Fabulous!  Had lunch at a wonderful restaurant there.  Antiche Terme di Dianativolita.We also had a great five days in Germany visiting friends there.  Our trip coming and going was great.  Loved flying first class.  I told Marvin that he would probably never get me on coach again.  A word of advice to your senior travelers.  Ask for wheelchair assistance while traveling in Europe.  We had an horrendous time getting through Heathrow on our way to Milan.  I requested wheelchair assistance on the return trip and it made things so much easier, although Marvin says that he gets to ride the wheelchair next time!We especially want to thank Giulia for looking out for us along the way.  Please send our best wishes to her.  All in all, our trip was perfect and we can't thank you enough for planning such a wonderful itenerary for us.  I certainly will recommend your company to friends.  Keep in touch.Grazie mille,Theresa  \"","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/11","location" => "Albuquerque, NM"],

We are all still talking at the end of the trip.  I would definitely recommend your agency to anyone planning a trip to Italy.  Rome by night on two Vespas was great  The next day with Francesca to see ancient Rome was wonderful.  Francesca is adorable and I wanted to take her home with me.  Monday morning I got sick.  Dinner the night before was veal scallopine in lemon sauce and then we shared tiramasu which was very rich.  I guess the combination did not agree with me.  Therefore, I was unable to do the Vatican tour.  Florence was beautiful and hotel Santa Maria Novella with our room facing the square was great.  Venice was wonderful but I have had enough water travel to last me a life time.  Water bus, water taxi, then three hour catamarran ride to Croatio followed by 1 1/2 hour taxi to ferry to take us across to Cres and then returning to Venice the same way.  It was great to meet my cousin, his wife and one of their daughters.  To visit the city of Cres where my father ws born and raised was nice.  I onlly wish that I had visited a long time ago before so much tourism.The one scare that I had happened when departing the water taxi at the Venice Airport.  We first boarded the water taxi and then the hotel person handed the lluggage to our driver.  30 minutes later we got off at the airport and the driver handed our luggage up to us.

In fact I was just thinking that I owed you an email now that back home.We had an AMAZING time!  It is always perfect when I get to spend time 1x1 with my daughter and to do it in such a wonderful place made it extra special.I had mentioned to you before how much of a fashionista/shopper my daughter always has been, so when we weren't on one of the tours on our itinerary, we were wandering around the city and spending time in and out of the many shops.My favorite things out of the time spent...The Rome Food Tour was fabulous - great food, great guide, great time.  Our Tuscan cooking class was another BIG HIGHLIGHT.  We received a free upgrade to the small group class in a Tuscan Villa because Trips2Italy is such a good client of the Florence tour company. It was great fun and Amanda and I even replicated the dish (bolognese sauce with home made pasta) when we were back in Berlin.  I hope to make it again sometime soon for my sons.We overslept and missed our early entry, small tour for the Vatican museums.  Still wanted to see it so we went with one of the public groups.  Really wish we hadn't missed our early entry one --- it was very crowded and hot and the groups were so large that although we can say we saw it, we really weren't able to SEE IT!All of the tour guides you arranged for us were very knowledgeable and shared their personal perspective on the cities they were in. I know Amanda wasn't real keen on the guided tour idea, but I think we learned so much more than we ever would have on our own. I especially enjoyed the two points of view on the Florence vs. Sienna preference.  After all the years, they both still think of themselves as \"better\" than their counterpart.  Some things aren't easily forgotten or forgiven apparently.We can't wait to go back sometime.  I'm sure there are some shops that we didn't find (although judging from the amount of items we purchased, I don't think there are many) and there are places we didn't see --- new cities.  We did mention that we should have prepared to take in an Italian Opera while in Italy!  The Trevi fountain was under renovation when we were there, so that would be another thing that I would say we missed.Thank you again to you and your staff for putting together our AMAZING trip to Italy!!!!

Our tour guide, Francesco, was so passionate about the history and telling us what life was like there… Rome was an anomaly with its ancient ruins standing in the middle of a busy city!  The Coliseum, Roman forum, and of course the Vatican and St. Peter's Basilica were astounding!  The Trevi fountain was under restoration, so there was no water in it.  That was a little disappointing  The Pantheon was beautiful too.  Instead of Orvieto we stopped in Pienza.  What a darling little town.  The views of Tuscany were breathtaking.  Florence had the Palazzo Vecchio where the statues were unreal!... Padua was a nice stop.  Scrovegni Chapel and St. Anthony's Basilica were beautiful.Venice, how is it above water???

It would be impossible to write every positive impression we had, but of particular note was the pizza making day… with Luccia, the guide - Elvira - at Pompeii and Pompeii ( ! ), … the day trip to San Gimagnano/Sienna,… and SERGIO who treated us like royalty, and the cooking class in Florence.

We both really enjoyed the whole trip and your tips came in very handy!  We already recommended your company to our friend who is also planning to go to Italy. Favorite thing we did was the food tour in Trastevere the first night. On the subsequent days in Rome we went back to several places that we visited on the tour.Least favorite was the tour to Pompeii. Pompeii we liked but the bus ride was pretty long and we stopped at a very tourist place on each way of the journey. We had plenty of time to see all we wanted in Venice but will almost certainly be back to Florence and Rome for a few more days sometime in the future.  Overall the trip achieved all our objectives - we saw many things and still had some time to relax and enjoy!Service was great also. Our flight was delayed arriving. I called the number listed on the voucher and all was sorted out immediately with our driver.

Everything was absolutely perfect!Our driver in Rome, Raphael, ended up at the wrong terminal to meet us, which initially concerned us that there would be problems. However, when he arrived - out of breath and so apologetic - everything went smoothly. He gave us a wonderful introduction to the beauty and history of Rome, while driving us around to see some of the sights. From there, every detail was perfect: every reservation, the weather, the hotels were spectacular. The way the trip was planned out, we had plenty of time for our scheduled events, plus plenty of time to wander on our own, or return to the hotels to relax. Language was no barrier - we used lots of hand gestures and smiles, as suggested. The food and wine were excellent, from the street food we found in Florence, to the casual lunches, to the excellent breakfasts at both hotels, to the elegant dinners we enjoyed both in Rome and Florence. In one restaurant in Florence, we discovered the owner had lived in Houston. As fellow \"Texans\", he gave us a bottle of wine as we left. We enjoyed it with our sandwiches while sitting in the sun in the Piazza Santa Maria Novella the next day. Our day in Tuscany was also a success, especially the lunch at the winery. Our ideas of returning home with wines from Italy was easily accomplished with the shipping they offered, and we added olive oils and balsamic vinegar to our order - a special treat for us in a few weeks from now. The natural beauty of the landscape was breathtaking. The history of the country is brought to life in the beautiful cities and villages we visited. Everywhere the art fills the eye and the soul. Our flights were all on time!! It was our first experience flying on KLM, and their service is first class. The airports were easy to navigate, as were the train stations. All was easy and perfect, as promised, and all went beyond our expectations. Ideas for our next trip to Italy entered the conversation on the flight home. We will return to Italy and to Trips 2 Italy when we are ready for our next adventure. Thank you for everything you planned and prepared for us. We did send a postcard from Florence, but couldn't wait for its arrival to tell you how much we loved our trip.This was the easiest travel experience we've had in many years, and we are sharing our happy stories and pictures with all our friends and family.

On the canal, beautiful, and an excellent staff.  The front desk manager readily provided a lot of guidance to maps, sites and restaurants and not only was the breakfast wonderful but the service was terrific.  Their service and friendliness set a high bar for the rest of the trip.Our guide, Suzanne, was incredible -very  knowledgeable and personable!  Having spent time with her, we felt that we had a lot of information about Venice and felt comfortable walking around and getting \"lost\".  She easily responded to all of our questions and we came away feeling that we just had a wonderful experience with her!  A nice break was the tour of the islands to see the specialities of the Venice culture.The Lucchesi in Florence could not have been nicer - perfect location on the Arno, upgraded to rooms with bedroom lofts, exceptional food and an outstanding concierge to recommend an anniversary dinner for Jim and Gail. We loved the area because we could walk everywhere!Our guide, Marco,  provided a terrific tour of Florence - historical details, insights into life and specialities of Florence (beautiful leather)!!  He also made sure that we ended the tour at our next destination, the Academia and knew how to get back to the hotel.  Our guide for La Cinque Terra, Alejandro , was again very knowledgeable.  This was  evident in understanding Carrera marble as we passed the mountain quarry, the beauty of the coastal region and the obstacles faced by the people who live there.  This tour was outstanding and Alejandro made it fun.  As we were driving to our hotel, we quietly noted that we wanted to find time in our schedule to climb to the Piazzale Michangelo for the outstanding view.The next morning who should appear as our driver to Tuscany by Alejandro and our first stop was the lookout at Piazzale Michangelo!  This is just one example of the attentiveness of each of the guides.  Again,  Alejandro demonstrated his knowledge and awareness of Sienna, San Gimignano and the country side throughout the trip.  Another fun day!  The Uffizi was unbelievable!  So glad that we moved it on the schedule so that we could take out time and really enjoy/appreciate the masters.  Perfect way to end the evening with the wine tasting at Livio's.  Small group experience and his expertise was amazing and the wines, cheese and salami pairings were excellent.  Sad to learn that most of the wines are not available outside Italy!!On to Rome and the Nazionale!  Again,  perfect choice in terms of location (easy to get everywhere) and they also gave us an upgrade to rooms on the 6th floor.  Looking out the window, we each had  clear view of the skyline of ancient Rome and the Vatican!  Our tours in Rome were unbelievable due to the expertise of Simon and Francesca!  We learned so much and both of them demonstrated their background in history and archeology.  The food tasting with Jasmine was equally excellent - homemade cookies, cheese, pasta.  Absolute perfect way to end the trip, fun and relaxing.It is important to note that every tour guide and driver was punctual, professional and personable.  Could not have had a better experience.  The only weak point was the night tour of Rome - unfortunately late getting off, open air Vespas were extremely noisy, bumpy, inhaling gas fumes, and the recordings in the phones often shut off due to bumps!  Good idea but still needs a better plan.Kim, thank you and Tomaso for the most wonderful trip!!  We had a great time, experienced Italy, and came home with wonderful memories and photos.It was great working with you on this trip and we look forward to the next time!!Mary and Mike","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/14","location" => "Boston, MA"],

Rome is truly a walking city! The city was great and the food was amazing… The train trip to Florence was amazing! Business class was most comfortable and it was not difficult to figure out the train station. We fell in love with Florence!!! The piazzas were beautiful and the tours that you set up for us were great. Our wine, cheese, and oil tasting ended up being a very private class...just us and the owner… Because we were offered the VIP cooking class, time did not allow us to see the David. So that is definitely a reason to go back!!!Venice was lovely...a bit more expensive and not quite as friendly as the other two cities, but lovely nonetheless. It was amazing to see a working city with no cars and only boats for transportation. I think the order of the cities was perfect. By the time we got to Venice we were ready to just relax and take in the sites. The timing of the tours and the transportation worked out very well and having the agent in Venice meet us at the train station was a great help!!!Overall, my experience with working with you and your staff was very good.

What diversity!We had a pizza making class in Sorrento that was one of the favorite things we did!  We were treated like family.  It was amazing!... Our visit to Pompeii was so educational. Our tour guide, Francesco, was so passionate about the history and telling us what life was like there… Rome was an anomaly with its ancient ruins standing in the middle of a busy city!  The Coliseum, Roman forum, and of course the Vatican and St. Peter's Basilica were astounding!  The Trevi fountain was under restoration, so there was no water in it.  That was a little disappointing  The Pantheon was beautiful too.  Instead of Orvieto we stopped in Pienza.  What a darling little town.  The views of Tuscany were breathtaking.  Florence had the Palazzo Vecchio where the statues were unreal!... Padua was a nice stop.  Scrovegni Chapel and St. Anthony's Basilica were beautiful.Venice, how is it above water???  The islands were unique.  Watching the glass blowing on Murano was so interesting.  Burano's little fishing village feel was cool.  Torcello was pretty,  The gondola ride was fun, and taking water taxis everywhere was pretty exciting.I can't say enough about the tour guides or the drivers.  They were so helpful, friendly, and informational!  They wanted us to be happy and get the most out of our trip.  We did not have one bad guide.  They were so fun, always smiling, giving us an education as we went…We should have stayed longer!... Our travel was seamless.

This was a nice location and made for easy walking to the tourist sites.  The room was accommodating, and we enjoyed the breakfast foods. On Sunday, we really enjoyed the small group walking tour and the tour guide – who was very friendly and knowledgeable.  It was very nice to be in a group of about 8 people, instead of a large group of 30 or so as we noticed as we walked around… Monday's Tuscany tour and wine tasting were lots of fun, and Kelly purchased some wine to ship home!... The transfer from Hotel to train station, navigating the train station, and riding the train were pretty easy.Our arrival at Pisa, connection with the tour guide, storage of the luggage, and actual tour were perfectly timed.  We also really enjoyed the tour guide and her descriptions of everything. Thanks for arranging the climb of the Pisa Tower! The tour of the Pisa cathedral was also fascinating… The train ride to Monterosso Al Mare was easy too.  The Hotel… was easy to find, and in a great location!  The daily breakfasts were great too.  Your pick of this town and the hotel were superb.  We really enjoyed our free time here.  On Wednesday, we hiked between Monterosso and Vernazza, took some fabulous pictures, and then trained to the other towns for more touring, eating, and shopping.  Thursday and Friday, we enjoyed sunning on the beach, relaxing, and enjoying the town.Friday’s departure from Monterosso was good.  The hotel was extremely accommodating by offering us a guest bathroom / shower to get cleaned up before departing the city.  Again – a perfect place to stay here!Our arrival and stay in Genoa was OK, but we were glad we didn’t have any more time spent there. The big industrial environment, shipping port, etc. were not to our preference.  The…Hotel… room was very nice…Again, overall, we had a GREAT vacation.  I really appreciate your patience through all of our planning questions, and your attention to detail for us to have such a wonderful experience.

I must say, it was so nice to have the transfers set up for us at each location (airport, train station, etc). Our bed and breakfast was very quaint and the owner, Sergio, was extremely welcoming - he had cookies and beers waiting for us at arrival! Plus, he had homemade treats for us at breakfast every morning as well as plenty of local travel advice if we asked for it. We loved that we were located near the Marina Grande which had great views and access to many local restaurants and the beach during the day. At night we would stroll into town to do some shopping and look for a nice restaurant for dinner.The tour to Mt. Vesuvius and Pompeii was good but not great. The tour guide was a bit difficult to understand and the tour group was large which meant things moved very slowly… However, we did learn a lot and successfully made it to the top of Mt. Vesuvius where the view was incredible!Thank you so much for helping to plan such a memorable trip for my husband and I. Your suggestions and travel advice were very useful.

Overall, it was a huge success thanks to your efforts. I thought you might appreciate some particulars. The pickup by Michael for our family transport to Venice was very good. In retrospect, a train would have been fine, but it was nice to not have to worry about that on our first day.  Michael was very pleasant and courteous.Hotel Canal Grande was fabulous. While it was not a 5 star (we didn’t want a 5 star) it was really everything we wanted. The rooms were beautiful and the hotel upgraded our room to a canal view suite without any request from us. The view was amazing. The staff was wonderful, accommodating and very friendly towards our family. The breakfast was terrific and very adequate for our perpetually hungry group. This was one of the highlights of our trip. And I hope you pass this along to our friends at the hotel, especially Gianni, Natasha, and Roxanne.Our guide in Venice was Rosanna, She was excellent, friendly, knowledgeable and very warm to our family. I would have liked to spend more time with her.Dinner was great most places though Trattoria Aquasanta was our favorite (near Rialto). Right next to that restaurant was another well-known place called Trattoria Madonna. We would not go back there. Too big, too commercial, food was OK, service was poor. Really poorOur guide in Verona was Katia “something”. She was very good, very friendly, and very knowledgeable. Our trip to Firenze on the train was nice. Our hotel, Santa Maria Novella, was nice as well, though I would definitely not stay there again. The rooms were nice, but far less appealing than Canal Grande. The staff was courteous and kind, though far less so than in Venice. The location of the hotel was nice and close to the train station, but I’m not sure that is so important. The breakfast was excellent. What we did not like was the layout of the hotel. We had 3 different rooms on 2 different floors. Even that was OK, but the floors are actually broken up into different levels so you need to go up AND down stairs on the SAME floors to get from one side to the other, and elevators do not reach all the floors. We stayed there for four nights and were still confused when we left. The lobby and entrance areas were beautiful, but overall, the hotel layout was a bit annoying. Our guide in Firenze was Marco, I do not recall his last name. He was the best. He was extremely knowledgeable, very engaging, charming, warm, and friendly. Our driver to the countryside was very nice and courteous. He was not very engaging or particularly warm and this was just his personality, I feel. Christiano was helpful and patient, but not as wonderful as our other guides. Siena was great, though I wish we had a guide. San Gimignano, though clearly very “touristy”, was worth the trip. The wine tasting was fun, that specific vineyard was a bit of a disappointment based only on my expectations. I was expecting a grander place, but perhaps they are all like that. Our Hotel in Bologna was very good and it worked out quite well. The drivers for our last trip to the airport were timely and everything worked out fine.In all, this was a magical trip that my family will always remember and cherish. We cannot wait to return, and when we do, I will look forward to speaking with you again to plan another extraordinary trip to an extraordinary country. I appreciate all your patience in dealing with the various issues my family had to manage with respect to different arrival and departure dates, etc.Every day, we all long to return to Italy. We LOVED this trip, and we cannot wait to return. If not for education expense, we would be planning our next trip for the fall!

The Hotel…  was nicely situated away from the center of town but close enough to walk to the Colosseum and the center of Roman civilization. The Tour of the Vatican was our favorite… Our tour guide was easy to understand and with the limited number on the tour we could ask questions and converse about what we saw. The booklet your group put together was excellent. It had many descriptions and tips on the places we visited. This included useful maps of the metro system, stores to visit, interesting history items, and some of your personal favorites of restaurants and walks from someone who knows and just visited the place.We especially enjoyed the water fountains, \"roman noses\" in Rome.

We cannot thank you enough for all the planning and arranging.  You guys are the best. All our guides were wonderful and so knowledgeable… We did a lot of walking and that was great. The best way to see a city, of course. Pasta & gelato & wine - we consumed as much as we could.  Mmmm. We saw everything that you booked for us and pretty much walked in the evenings. Nothing extra but the food and the walking. And a bit of shopping. :) I have to say the Palio was a big hit. That day couldn't have been any better. We were visiting the San Domenico church when the group from the Dragon district came in, drums and all. That was a sight… Goose district won the race (as I'm sure you already know!) and then the crowd went out right under our window with the banner and the jockey. And as we walked back to meet the driver, we walked through the Goose district again just as they were parading through with the banner. And then we bought Goose flags, which the boys have hung over their bedroom doors. The apartment was perfect. Cool and they even had food and wine for us. Yay wine!… I think Venice was my favorite for photography. The light there is simply breathtaking…  Again, we don't have the words to tell you what a great trip this was. My mom and all of us are thoroughly impressed with all you did for us. From the drivers to the guides - all of it - everything was so well executed. Your timing was perfect on everything.

Osteria... was amazing… Finally, the cooking class was a perfect end to our trip.  We not only learned more than we thought we would but the experience itself was fantastic.  Very casual, in a very good way, and the chef was obviously an expert in his field.

The hotel in Venice was very quaint and we loved the tour you booked, there was a lot to see, but we got to enjoy a lot of free time to shop and sight see on our own.  Riding in a gondola was wonderful…  The train ride to Rome allowed some time for recuperation.  The hotelin Rome was in a great location - we spent a lot of time in the area below the Spanish Steps, in and out of all the great shops.  The tour company you used was also great... The Vatican tour guide was especially fun and enthusiastic… and I would recommend her to all English speaking guests. The Colosseum Tour was also great - we were blown away by all the sites and history.  The tour guide, Fabrizio really knew his stuff! We absolutely loved having dinner and wine in Piazza Novana at night and we really enjoyed the restaurant you recommended ... Our favorite part of the trip however was our time is Sorrento.  The private car was a great way to travel from Naples and really enjoy the scenery.  The hotel you chose was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  We would definitely stay there again.  The view from our room was unbelievable and the breakfast every morning overlooking Mount Vesuvius was incredible… The tour of the Amalfi Coast was a great way to see the different towns - we loved Amalfi and Ravello.  That tour guide, Giovanni, was also a lot of fun… Tommaso - you truly did a wonderful job planning this trip for us and we have already recommended you to everyone we know.

The trip plan was perfect. We did do quite a lot, so next time we might take breaks in between everything. So let me start with the private transfers, they were all very nice Mercedes Benz sedan or the van. They were on time and very nice. Our hotel in Sorrento was nice in the fishing village. … we just ate dinner in the fishing village at Trattoria Emilia and it was great (One of Tomasso's recommendations) We really liked going on the day trips… Train was nice from Naples to Rome. Rome was amazing as always. The receptionist was from Sri Lanka and he was very helpful and nice. The hotel was very nice and in a perfect location. The only thing was the bed was hard. Breakfast was nice as in all the restaurants. Bathrooms were very clean. We had a great Vatican Tour… We LOVED the cooking class. Fabio and Dario were great. Fabio did the walking tour everywhere from the Jewish Ghetto, to the Trevi, to the Campo Di Fiori, and then the class was fantastic. Dario taught Paul and myself how to make Ravioli… The whole meal was DELICIOUS! … So, then off to Florence. Our hotel in Florence was the best. Very comfortable and the friendliest staff and good location. One staff member even dropped us off at the train station they day we were going to Venice and it was very nice of him… We did the San Gimigano, Siena and Chianti tour and that was from 9 to 7 so that took up that day and we were exhausted since it was quite long, but it was a great trip. Really enjoy the Chianti farm we went to and seeing the winery and learning about how they make the wine, olive oil, honey, lotions, etc. This farm did everything. We brought back 10 bottles of wine …. Everything was planned perfectly. We might need a resting vacation now, but we really had a wonderful time, and thanks for organizing everything. It went very smoothly. It was good to start from the South and go up to Venice. I could eat pizza, pasta and gelato everyday and not get tired and that's what we did! We did a lot of walking, but the buses were very handy to go around everywhere. We saw everything we could in those 12 days.

Our trip worked out just a planned.  Our flights were all good, connections worked out.  Rental car and driving was easier than we anticipated... Liguria was beautiful.  Cesare in Monterosso was a great host.  The apartment we used was large and very nice, we were spoiled for the rest of the trip.  You told us Liguria required a lot of walking, but we were not prepared for the walking up or walking down or the distance we had to drag our luggage from the parked car.  I encourage you to give stronger advise to people regarding the walking and the cost of parking... the Albergo San Lorenzo was a disappointment.  The service and people were outstanding and very helpful.  The room was small – even by European standards... Our room was on the 1st floor and was extremely noisy...

Our flights were all good, connections worked out.  Rental car and driving was easier than we anticipated...Liguria was beautiful.  Cesare in Monterosso was a great host.  The apartment we used was large and very nice, we were spoiled for the rest of the trip... The people at the ... Winery in Monterosso are very kind and nice.  The winery is up the hill from ... B & B and the wine tasting offered was very nice.  We spent a delightful afternoon at the winery.  The train between the 5 towns was efficient and convenient.  The boat trip was “touristy.” The truffle exhibit was fascinating!  The sights and smells in the exhibit hall were fabulous.  The food and wine tasting was great...Thank you so much for the tickets to the Palio.  We were unsure what we were getting into, but the staff at the hotel and shop below (especially Francesca) were very helpful and encouraged us to go for the entire event.  The skits presented by each of the districts in Alba were interesting... The donkey races were just about the funniest thing we have ever seen.  We laughed and laughed, what great fun!Our tours were just as we anticipated.  The guide, Alexandra, was knowledgeable and very pleasant.  Her English language skills were very good.  She was well spoken and understandable.  The drivers were professional and very familiar with the roads.We hope this feedback is helpful.  We had a great time on our Italian vacation.Thank you and all the staff at Trips 2 Italy!Best regards,Rick & Cara M.","pagination" => "https://www.trips2italy.com/travel-reviews/page/37","location" => "USA"],
